The charge didn't last long enough to get my hair done (I do have long and thick hair) so YMMV but the second time I tried to use it, it seems that the charge didn't even last as long as the first.

AH6JLX5SJSUOJBBT6RRE2RDXIG6A,Likeable liquid lipstick,"To me the shade on the product picture looks like it might have a little pink in it but I don't notice it when I apply it. Maybe that's just me 🤔 Regardless, I feel the shade is very pretty...and definitely is metallic.<br /><br />It's also very long-lasting- to the point that later when taking it off, I used both an oil cleanser and makeup remover. Transferring is minimal. It actually stays a little sticky the whole time while wearing it, so that makes it a little surprising that it's so long lasting- since many liquids dry completely. It's not overly sticky, so I didn't find it bothersome.<br /><br />Applies smoothly- it does feel like a velvety, whipped texture<br /><br />If you're concerned about the appearance of lines on your lips with a liquid lipstick- I feel this is one makes them a bit pronounced.<br /><br />Overall, for a liquid lipstick, I think it's pretty good. Has rich pigment and has a stand-out metallic look<br /><br />Packaging is pretty",B0BVQQ58G8,1658366200714,4.0

AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,"Moisturizes, Comforts, Some Color Correction-Emphasizes My Pores, Need An Ingredient List","JUNGSAEMMOOL Minifying Cica Mist Balm is a moisturizing balm for sensitive skin that soothes irritation and helps redness. It’s described as having green calamine to tone down redness and cica pine water to calm skin. But I’m unable to find a full ingredient list. The box has directions in English but lacks an ingredient list in English, so I don’t know what’s even in this product. I have dry, sensitive skin and avoid many skincare ingredients, so I won’t make this balm or any product part of my daily routine without an ingredient list.<br /><br />I have used this balm a few times after my moisturizer and before foundation (if wearing makeup). The balm smells light and pleasant, and it adds some comforting moisture. While it tends to sink into my skin, I do get some color correction of redness on my nose and cheeks. But it’s less than I get with my corrective color makeup. If the balm has healthy ingredients that benefit my skin while also correcting some degree of redness, I’d likely prefer it to just hiding redness with makeup. But I can’t judge if the trade off is there without knowing ingredients.<br /><br />This balm also makes my skin smoother. It feels like it might have silicone and/or glycerin and feels a lot like a primer under my makeup. I like the moist and spreadable texture, except it’s so soft I can’t just swipe across the top with the puff for an even amount of product as it smooshes in the balm and gouges out pieces (which I then spread and dab with the puff). It becomes less noticeable as the balm soaks in, but I don’t like that this settles into and emphasizes pores on my nose. This is just okay for me. 3 stars.

AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,"Pretty Metallic Looks More Bronze Than Rose, Sticky Formula, Feels Drying, Best w/ Gloss Over It","This Beauty Bakerie Lip Whip Liquid Metallic Lipstick in Rosé Posé comes in a cute tube and is a pretty metallic color lipstick that spreads on with a sponge type wand. The color reads darker on me than I’d expect from the photo, but it’s a lovely metallic shade that looks like a bronze with rose hue or a little rose gold in it. I have light skin with an olive hue and rosy color lips, and this color is flattering but is probably even better on medium and dark skin tones.<br /><br />But, while this lipstick initially spreads on smooth and velvety, it stays sticky and doesn’t fully dry down on me even with just one application. It doesn’t feel comfortable as I tend to get dry lips and it adds no moisture (and may be drying my lips more). Used alone, it accentuates lines and flakiness even used after a great lip scrub. And it doesn’t work applied over a little lip balm as it rolls off in weird little pieces. For me, it’s best with a little gloss over it, but it still feels sticky and rolls off (to a lesser extent) if I rub my lips together. Overall, it’s just okay at best. 3 stars.",B0BVQQ58G8,1658671602427,3.0

When I applied it to dry bare skin using the puff it pilled slightly, I did get better results blending it with my finger tips. It leaves an overall light green veil of color on bare skin that's not overly noticeable and leaves a matte finish. Don't let the matte finish fool you though, it melts into your skin leaving it moisturized without feeling greasy.<br /><br />My skin is only slightly sensitive and when irritated doesn't react with major noticeable redness or heat.

Not huge like some cleaning bottle sprayers. The nozzles can be turned from mist to stream and everything in between. The tube reaches to the bottom, so there is less waste. The bottles are clear so you can fill them and monitor them easily.<br /><br />These probably won't last a lifetime, but I'm happy with them.

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"Reduced redness & hydrating, but need ingredient list in ENGLISH!","This comes in a nice outer product box. Made in Korea. The brand’s website said it’s 100% vegan, excluding animal ingredients and animal experiments. It also doesn’t include parabens.<br /><br />It comes in a nice compact. It’s a compact like a cushion foundation where you open it and there’s a kind of lid that holds the sponge applicator, and you lift that lid to reveal the product. You press the applicator sponge into it (or your own sponge or brush) and then apply it. The brand’s website said the included sponge applicator is an “eco puff” made of “eco-friendly corns” and is “99.9% anti-bacterial and water-repellent,” which makes it safe on skin and keeps puff clean.<br /><br />This is a liquidy but balm kind of texture. It isn’t as thick as a balm. It just feels like a cushion foundation. But this isn’t a foundation. It has a very light, mint green color to it. It’s so light that it’s almost white but has the green color to it. When applied, it reduces redness. It doesn’t do as well as my more pigmented green correctors, but it does a nice job while being hydrating and lightweight on the skin. It’s something that works well before applying foundation. It is lightweight enough to wear well under foundation. It isn’t a primer really, it doesn’t smooth out the skin or fill in pores. But, it does reduce the redness in my skin so then I use less foundation and concealer. If you have a TON of redness or it’s REALLY red, this might not be enough since it isn’t extremely pigmented. But, it will make a difference. I like it isn’t drying on the skin either.<br /><br />I’m just not sure how I feel about it though. It works well on the skin. But, I do like to know what’s in my products. I don’t like that they provided barely any product info, and the ingredients on the product box weren’t in English. They also didn’t include them here on the product page. Not even the product photos provided any real info on the product - what it does, who it’s for, how to use it, ingredients, etc. I had to go to the brand’s website to find out more. Yes, it’s a simple Google search, but it’s not really something you  should have to do.<br /><br />Normally, I would just go to the brand’s website to find the list of ingredients when they’re not included on the Amazon product page. But, the Jung Saem Mool website didn’t have them on their website either. I looked for them elsewhere and did find an ingredient list on Korean Beauty Box, but didn’t think they were accurate because they didn’t include centella asiatica, pine sprout, or green calamine powder, which are supposed to be in this product. So, I translated the ingredients from the box myself. But, I’m not that confident in the ingredients provided on the box.(I included a photo from the box, and also included the ingredients at the end of my review in English)<br /><br />It doesn’t seem like a complete list of ingredients to me. It has the first ingredient as titanium dioxide. It has tocopherol (vitamin E) as the 3rd ingredient. The rest of the ingredient are 7, kind of versions I’d guess you’d call them, of centella asiatica. There’s nothing else listed. It’s kind of odd. The brand’s website said this is supposed to have “2 plants - pine sprout containing fresh moisture and centella asiatica roots.” I saw the “centella asiatica roots” in the ingredients when I translated them. But didn’t see any “pine sprout.” I also saw something about “cica pine water” on the brand’s website, but again, not sure what that’s supposed to be? The brand’s website also mentioned “Natural green calamine powder covers reddened skin tone.” Again, I didn’t see any calamine powder at all in the ingredients.<br /><br />The 7, I guess versions, of Centella Asiatica are:<br />Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) - Well known soothing, antioxidant, and moisturizing ingredient. Anti-inflammatory. The main biologically active components are Asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid. All of which are in this.<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm)<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm)<br /><br />Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica. It’s less prominent than it’s sister component, Asiaticoside, but it still contributes to the well-established moisturizing and wound healing abilities of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Overall, it works well. It reduces my redness, feels hydrating on the skin, and works well on its own and under foundation. It feels lightweight on the skin. If they provided the full ingredient list, it would be something I’d be willing to purchase. But, right now, I don’t like they didn’t include them and don’t like that they can’t even be found online as far as I could tell. And I just have a hard time believing the ingredient list I translated from the box is the full ingredient list. I don’t know. If the ingredients aren’t a big factor for you, this is nice and works well. If knowing the ingredients are important to you, I’d look elsewhere. There’s other similar products that actually provide a full ingredient list, and a lot of them are far cheaper. I give it 3 stars.<br /><br />How to Use (from brand’s website):<br />Use as last step of skin care routine. Dip puff into content and gently apply and dab on skin.<br /><br />Special Tips (from brand’s website)<br />Carry it in makeup bag or purse for easy supply of moisture to skin when it dries up.<br />Use as lightweight skin tone corrector to correct sensitive skin tone covered by masks instead of applying heavy, caking makeup.<br /><br />FULL INGREDIENTS<br />Ingredients | Titanium dioxide (CI 77891], Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm), Tocopherol, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm), Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm), Madecassoside (0.0025ppm), Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm), Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm), Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm)<br /><br />**NOTE: Just for reference, 1ppm = 0.0001% (or 10,000 ppm = 1%). So…<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) = 515.9235%<br />*5,159,235ppm is parts per million, so it means there’s 5,159,235 parts of Centella Asiatica in one million molecules<br />Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm) = 0.0000035%<br />Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm) = 0.000003%<br />Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%",B0B4MR9BXN,1666805038080,3.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,2 of 3 have micro glitter (mica). Sticky but not too bad. Moisturizing,"These come in a nice little box. They are vegan and cruelty free. They are made in the USA. I included the ingredients at the end of my review.<br /><br />You get 3 glosses - a peachy pink toned one that has a strawberry scent/flavor, a more reddish toned one that has a grape scent/flavor, and a clear one that has a bubble gum scent/flavor. As for the scents, I can notice them when applying, not so much after the fact. I don’t really notice a taste really with any of them, but the ingredients do list “flavor” not fragrance/parfum, so it made me think they’d have more taste to them. Not a big deal to me though.<br /><br />While 2 of them are tinted in color, the color doesn’t really translate onto the lips. They just look clear on the lips. They don’t change any color of lip liner, lipstick, matte lip, etc. that I put them over top of. So, I liked that.<br /><br />The formula is nice. It feels nice and moisturizing on the lips, which I expected given they have nice moisturizing ingredients like Shea butter, coconut oil, and squalane. They do feel SLIGHTLY sticky on the lips. I hate sticky glosses, but these aren’t overly sticky. They don’t feel thick or heavy on the lips. They feel nice and thin. They are glosses so they do need re-applied often throughout the day. But, I’m used to that with glosses so it’s not a big deal to me.<br /><br />The strawberry and grape both have micro glitter in them (mica). I didn’t know that when I got these. None of the product photos showed they had glitter and the description didn’t say it either. I’m not a fan of micro glitter in my lip glosses. I feel once the gloss wears off, it usually leaves behind glitter particles on my lips. Also, they can sometimes feel gritty. So, I was surprised when I saw 2 of the 3 had glitter. Luckily, these didn’t feel gritty. I do notice that there are some glitter particles on my lips after they wear off, but it’s not too bad. The glitter particles are really small, so it’s not really noticeable. So, I don’t mind that.<br /><br />Overall, these are nice glosses with a nice formula. They might seem pricey when seeing the $30 price tag, but you’re getting 3 tubes of glosses, so that’s only $10 a piece, which isn’t bad. Of course, it isn’t great. You can get a tube of gloss that looks great and works just as well from the drugstore for slightly less. But, the ingredients might make it worth it to spend the little more. I give them 4 stars.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Bubblegum Lip Glossy:<br />Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Isododecane, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Flavor, Sorbitan Oleate, Squalane, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate).<br /><br />*Organic/Biologique.<br /><br />Grape Lip Glossy:<br />Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Isododecane, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Flavor, Sorbitan Oleate, Squalane, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Tocopherol, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Iron Oxides (CI 77492), Red 33 (CI#17200), CI 15850 (Red 7), Iron Oxides (CI 77499).<br /><br />*Organic/Biologique.<br /><br />Strawberry Lip Glossy:<br />Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Isododecane, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Flavor, Sorbitan Oleate, Squalane, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Tocopherol, Titanium Dioxide, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mica, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Iron Oxides (CI 77492), Red 27 Lake (CI 45410), Silica, Tin Oxide.<br /><br />*Organic/Biologique",B09SH1FD9S,1656203229874,4.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Gorgeous!! Such A Great Set!,"[[VIDEOID:a7c1d14af37e75840e647b8774b319cb]] I have been wanting to get a variety of different liquid glitter eyeshadows, but I kept only finding them where you have to buy them individually. I was happy to see this set of 4!<br /><br />These liquid glitter eyeshadows are GORGEOUS!<br /><br />They come in a product box. The tubes of product have gold caps and clear tubes, so you can see the shade. The brand name and logo is on the front of the tubes in gold. The applicator is a nice sized doe foot - not too big for my small eyes, but big enough. These are short tubes, so the applicator is short. But, it’s still easy to hold and maneuver. The shade number and name are on a sticker on the bottom of the tube.<br /><br />You get 4<br />- 001 Mauve Plum - Mauve liquid shadow with silver glitter.<br />- 002 Rosy Gold  - Rose gold liquid shadow with silver glitter.<br />- 003 Silver Flash - White liquid shadow with silver glitter<br />- 004 Sparkle Midnight - Black liquid shadow with silver glitter.<br /><br />They all look so beautiful. The shimmer with them looks even with application. You can layer them well. They don’t take too long to dry. They lasted well on my hooded eyes without creasing (that is, no more than what I normally get with any eyeshadow). When the light hits these they look so beautiful.<br /><br />I show photos of swatches - I did 1 swipe for each color. Then I did little areas where I layered the colors to show how they built up. I also did a video showing them.<br /><br />I think this is such a great set! To get 4 liquid glitter shadows for $13.99 (at the time of writing this review), I think that’s a great deal! All other liquid glitter shadows I’ve found were sold individually and buying 4 would have been way more than this set costs! I’m definitely going to be using these up and hoping they’ll come out with additional colors soon!!",B08DK5D9J5,1606080727104,5.0
