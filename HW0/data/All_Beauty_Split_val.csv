AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,The cream is blue but goes on clear; it is very hydrating; looks like ½ a jar,"The photo on Amazon must be wrong. This cream is blue and not white. I hate colored creams. However, this goes on clear and was so super hydrating to my face, that I did not mark it down for the color. Note that the box it came in was all smashed and it was almost double the size of the jar. They could have fit almost two jars of this in the box. In addition, the cream in the jar looks half full.<br /><br />I love the results but not the packaging or the color or the jar being half full.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 for 1.69 fluid ounces is competitive. NOTE THE SIZING (.05 fluid ounces) SPECIFIED ON AMAZON is wrong too.",B08HVRP54L,1653607216628,3.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Light-weight cream that is a bit tacky to start; slightly moisturizing once absorbed; scentless,"This comes in a one gallon jug. There are two negatives to me. First, the biggest negative is that it takes work to dispense the lotion. Second, this lightweight lotion goes on tacky and takes a few minutes to absorb. Once absorbed, however, it is lightly moisturizing and it leaves my skin soft.<br /><br />This is vegan per the bottle and the lotion is scentless. My favorite lotion is [[ASIN:B09HYPWMKG Ginger Lily Farms Pure Morocco Argan Oil Butter Lotion]]. That is perfect for a massage as well. It has a fragrance and is cruelty-free but not vegan.<br /><br />This is decent but the initial tackiness I dislike. The current price of $54.99 for 128 ounces comes to $.43 per ounce, which is almost double the price of the lotion I love.",B08N5NDVGH,1647381362768,3.0

It contains a beautiful compact mirror with regular and close-up mirrors on the inside. Both mirrors are small but functional. It is fashioned like a pocket watch. The clasp is solid and the finish is high-gloss like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside of both sides of the mirror is inspirational. It says ""Beautiful girl you can do amazing things.""<br /><br />There is also a small dish for jewelry and a very cheap make-up case all with the same inspirational verse.<br /><br />In summary, this is a nice gift set. The current price of $20.89 ($21.99 minus 5%) is competitive.",B092M5K59T,1638840554514,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Cute MOM gift but not as fragrant or impressive as I expected,"[[VIDEOID:f77804a8088c40dfbef6fdcfacf8b15a]] There are three individually wrapped bath bombs in this set along with one bar of hand soap and a package of dried rose petals. In total there are five items. The bath bombs spell MOM with the heart substituting for the letter O.<br /><br />The outside packaging looks giftable but the inside is just an ordinary uninspiring throw-away box. The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. It has a whisper of rose aroma and I detect no lavender at all. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes. The results initially felt moisturizing because my hands felt a little oily after the hand bath; however, eventually I needed to moisturize my hands with lotion.<br /><br />With regard to the dried petals, one has to like something like that in their bath because it requires straining the water so that they don't go down the drain. For me, I would never use petals in a bath, so keep the recipient in mind when ordering this.<br /><br />The bar of soap is the only item that would be used by most people.<br /><br />One thing I love is that the color of the dissolved bomb did not adhere to my skin, my hand bath, or my towel. That is not always the case with bath bombs today.<br /><br />The current price of $9.74 ($12.99 minus 25%) comes to $1.95 per item which is reasonable.",B095CG2ZV1,1631367075148,3.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Fragrance is subtle but lovely and floral; just enough to freshen up an area or relax to,"This is a nice room freshener. The fragrance is subtle but lovely and floral. Some fragrances give me a headache if they are too strong but this one does not. I love spraying this in my bedroom. It is also a great fragrance to relax with before falling asleep--no dangerous scented candle needed. It does not help promote sleep for me but it is soothing to my senses. The aroma does not last long--about 15 minutes. I happen to like fragrance, so I do like this linen spray.",B08T7GPT1D,1625006698955,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Very functional basic brush set; wish handles were longer; love the bristle color,"There are 9  soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />Each brush comes individually packaged. In fact it is over packaged. The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel good against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. I do wish the handles were a tad longer. Nevertheless, the current price of $8.99 is an super reasonable for this set as it comes to $1 per brush.<br /><br />This is a perfect set for the young teenager starting out on her make-up journey.",B0919R1CYT,1624659702420,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Wafer-thin portable soap; dissolves instantly; good lather; fragrance does not come thru on hands,"There are three packages of wafer thin sheets of soap in 80 sheets each pack. The wafers are attached in the center but pull apart easily. There is also a sliding top tin supplied that will hole 80 sheets. Be careful not to get them wet as even a drop of water causes them to dissolve. When I washed my hands with one sheet, it created a nice lather and left my hands clean. I do not feel that it was moisturizing as claimed. Also, even though there are three wonderful fragrances (lavender & aloe, bergamot & ylang ylang, and jasmine & patchouli) that smell great as a whole 80 sheets, that fragrance does not come through on the hands because the soap is too thin to leave any fragrance behind.<br /><br />The current price of $13.95 comes to $.06 cents per sheet. I consider these perfect for when using a public restroom that has water but no soap. It is also great for camping or any place where portability is paramount without carrying a full wet bar of soap in a container.",B09473GGM4,1624274497670,4.0

AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,A Good Aloe/Hyaluronic Gel Cream-(but the jar isn't full?),"This is a nice, light gel cream packed with aloe and hyaluronic acid, 2 things I love to use on my dry, sensitive aging skin. Easy to apply-a little goes a long way. Absorption is fast and does not leave a greasy/stick feel behind.  Instantly hydrates and soothes the red patches of inflammation that plagues my skin.<br /><br />The cream itself if a light blue-ish/grey-ish color but don't worry, it doesn't discolor skin. There is a  bit of a scent that I find to be medicinal though it fades quickly.<br /><br />I do not know if it occurred during shipping (the product shifted) or if its normal but my jar seemed to be missing some cream (see photo). Despite this, its still a good, affordable cream that works well on even the driest of skin.",B08HVRP54L,1654910784744,4.0
AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,High Quality Product That Delivers High Quality Results,"""Best shave I've ever had.  Gives me a close shave with no tugging. Better than an electric razor"".<br /><br />That's the first thing my husband had to say after he tested SUPRENT's  Matrix Cutter Head travel kit razor for the first time.  And what a kit this is. A razor handle, 2-blade refills (each with the first of its kind 6 ultra-thin blades total!), a dock to hold the razor and a bottle of shaving foam are included.<br /><br />The handle is sleek and heavy but easy and comfortable to hold.  The head doesn't pivot  but it doesn't need to thanks to the 38.5 degree shaving angle. It glides perfectly along the jaw line and chin areas without missing a spot.<br /><br />The base is heavy-ish and holds the razor well. Doesn't tip or wobble.<br /><br />He's not a fan of the shaving foam. Says he must 'really rub it in' in order for it to foam.  He used it once and switched back to his regular brand.<br /><br />Suprent has really come out with an awesome razor kit. The presentation is gorgeous and the product works exceptionally well.  Without a doubt this is worthy of gift giving.  The price is reasonable.<br /><br />Highly recommended",B0932Z1NM1,1630609578211,5.0
AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,Crisp and Refreshing!,"I LOVE Hask hair products. I'm a huge fan and have been for some time. So, I was super excited test Hask's body wash.  But I had a problem right from the start. I had to decide between 4 fantastic choices!  Coconut, Lavender + Vanilla, Cucumber + Aloe and Shea + Cocoa Butter. Since it was very warm outside the day I ordered and with summer rapidly approaching, I chose Cucumber + Aloe.<br /><br />Perfect choice!<br /><br />This is a 2 pack of 24.5oz Hask Cucumber + Aloe Body wash. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. The bottle's pump dispenses easily as well as a  good amount of body wash. It lathers quickly and does a great job of cleansing skin.  I also use it while shaving my legs and it works well.  When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.  The aloe helps hydrate and moisturize my dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />The 2 bottles are big in size and will last for quite some time in our home.  That, along with the great results make the price reasonable. Recommended!",B08SG2MBRY,1621575250672,5.0
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,"lightweight, natural coverage, dewy, has goodly amount of sunscreen","#21 light neutral beige, and it is a pretty good match to my fair, cool skin.<br /><br />My skin: fair, dry, mid 40s, pink cheeks from Rosacea (visible veins, zero acne). I find that this has light natural coverage using a foundation brush. It tones down my redness with ease. It can be built up, especially if allowed to semi dry between applications. I really like that it has SPF (PA++++) 50. I always use sunscreen, so adding this on top of my sunscreen base is just added protection. Also perfect for reapplication & touch ups through day.<br /><br />I also find that it is hydrating on my dry skin. Has a dewy finish. My natural skin comes through but looks better- more spruced up and put together looking. I do notice that the finish depends on what I use before hand. When I have used this on bare skin, it has a more mattifying appearance. When I use on top of my moisturizer and/or moisturizing sunscreen, then it has a more dewy radiant look. I prefer the latter.<br /><br />Seems to stay in place. I applied some to my forearm, and it is still in place a couple hours later. I have taken my finger to try to wipe it off, and it is still there.<br /><br />4 stars. I prefer it for light coverage. When it is built up, it seems to take on a grayish cast on me.",B08K2WH8LK,1632849212320,4.0
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,hydrating toner adds moisture and other nourishing ingredients.,"Nice feeling moisture boost. Lightweight, nothing oily about it to me. My dry skin loves a good hydrating toner, and this fits that need. I pat some on all over face, neck and chest. Sometimes I do this a few times to saturate my skin. Then I follow up with other products (serum, moisturizer, and/or sunscreen). Ceramides help build and maintain a healthy skin barrier. Hyaluronic acid attracts moisture (but be sure to lock it in with a moisturizer or an occlusive ingredient). Sedum provides intense hydration & minerals, and vitamins to the skin. So lots of good stuff going on with this toner.",B084WP4XS8,1620487703457,5.0

Overall healthy save for redness & visible veins from Type 1 Rosacea (no bumps, no acne, just redness).<br /><br />Reminds me of some of the thick, luscious, rich leave on night ""masks"" that I use. Really nice used alone, or paired with their real ampoule drops, or with your own routine. Just slather on, allow some time to absorb before hitting the pillow. Wake with supple, soft, dewy, nourished, revitalized skin. I'm impressed.<br /><br />I haven't had skin procedures, but this seems like a go-to item if I were to ever have something done- whether it be professional dermabrasion, laser, basically anything that leaves skin a little raw and exposed for a few days and would benefit from a more healing like cream.<br /><br />the drops: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4FDWKP",B08QVJ4NVD,1618246231408,5.0
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,"very light, absorbs well, works well alone or over other skin care products","My skin is dry, totally clear (no acne) save for some redness & visible veins from Type 1 rosacea. This sunscreen feels quite gentle and does not seem to irritate my skin at all. It adds a light but effective level of hydration without feeling heavy. It is a chemical sunscreen, so zero white cast. It is thin, and goes on like a light lotion. Typical viscosity among my other K-beauty brands.<br /><br />I have a wide assortment of sunscreen, of various formulations and types. It is my #1 skin care product as I use it daily all year long. It is a habit. I avoid the sun for a few reasons, so sunscreen is vital to my well being. I live in a variable climate (from dry, freezing temps to humid hot) and I have sunscreen preference depending on season and situation. I tend to prefer mineral (my fair skin can handle any white cast) but do utilize chemical sunscreen often.<br /><br />I am going to like this for basic daily summer use. I tend to reduce my morning skin care routine down to a basic wash or splash of water and a moisturizing sunscreen. Since this offers SPF 50 (P++++), I know my skin is going to be pretty well protected. Since it feels like a moisturizer and goes on clear, I can skip my other skin care if I want. I tend to skip morning skin care in the summer because I am likely to just sweat it off anyway (I have a more involved night time routine to make up for it). So a sunscreen such as this is easy to use, makes my skin feel good, and easy to reapply throughout the day. I dont wear make up usually, but for sake of review I used it under a light foundation tint. Seems to play well- I didnt notice any rolling/pilling. I'll use it up. I have also used it over other skin care (hydrating toner, serum, light moisturizer) and it worked well on top of all that too.<br /><br />Not sure yet if it will be repurchase.

I like to keep my make up simple, so I often go for an eye shadow pencil; something I can swipe on in a single color and be done. I often go for very light colors, or even more into brown or purple. This ""chalfont 303- a shimmering shade of pearl"" reminds more of a yellow tinged shimmery champagne rather than what I think of as pearl (white leaning pink). It is definitely not a white pink, too bad.  I may use it blended in with something, but it otherwise looks sallow on my fair, pink skin with blue undertones. I do however love the ease of use, how it does not irritate my eyes at all, and it just goes on so smoothly.",B08JCX3DL7,1610155682447,4.0

AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,"This Is A Great Design- But Caution, How To Get Out Of A Jam","I have baby fine hair.  Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.  I know it is supposed to stay, but mine doesn't.  Other than that, this would get five stars, but I am taking one off for that.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I posted a photo of my hair so you can see how curly it is.

I was worried it would fall off when shaving but it stood firm. The magnetic feature makes it super easy to change heads. Unfortunately I didn’t  see any replacement heads to order on Amazon. I would have liked the kit to come with more heads,  it comes with two, one to use and one replacement . I really like the aloe strip that surrounds the 5 blades , most of my other razors it’s just on one side. The razor cuts close and is comfortable to use.

AF4P6A3SEKS2HCISWAKFZVIFM7NQ,Suited More for 6+ and Older,"A few things here …<br /><br />LES ENFANTS is French for CHILDREN<br /><br />It doesn’t refer to infants or toddlers. For those who don’t know, a quick note …<br /><br />Newborn – birth to 4 weeks<br />Infants – 4 weeks to 1 year<br />Toddler – 1-3<br />Preschooler – 3-5<br />Child – 6-13<br /><br />That said …<br /><br />It does state NOT TO SPRAY IT ON A BABY’S SKIN. “Applying gently on clothes” is the preferred method. Though to be honest, I’d say this is more for ages 6+<br /><br />While baby cologne isn’t something I would use on a baby, it could be better for adults who want a light scent and not overwhelmed by a perfume.<br /><br />For almost $30, this is an 8.5 fl oz spray. Compared to some perfumes and colognes, this is moderately priced.<br /><br />Smell? It isn’t the greatest. I do like it as a light, after-bathing scent. It seems more suited to a room freshener than a perfume. But, it isn’t the WORST perfume/scent I’ve smelled.<br /><br />The generous size means it will last a while.<br /><br />Would I get it again? No. Nor would I recommend it either.",B09G3KBK7Y,1649119586038,3.0
AF4P6A3SEKS2HCISWAKFZVIFM7NQ,Great for Travel,"As most have said here – these are great for travel, especially when you can’t find soap around but have water. Though I wouldn’t carry a bar of soap, I have used “travel” size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway …<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don’t intend to travel where I won’t have soap. So, I’m using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me – it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don’t really smell a “scent”, hands wash clean. They don’t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn’t say these go years – if you’re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup – they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they’re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That’s just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.",B09473GGM4,1626746723600,3.0

AEAXAJACFMXIAAH4WOHRMXPSZWFA,Vintage GLAMOUR in RED,"From pin-up girls to starlets, from old Hollywood movie queen royalty to the girls at the automat, certain red lipsticks have dominated makeup counters for decades.<br />This is one of them.<br /><br />Everything about this lipstick, except for the modern wearability, is vintage glamour. The shape of the tube and the shape of the lipstick itself harkens to another era. Perfect for making the ultimate Cupid's bow pout. It even has that slight fragrance that will remind you of vintage lipsticks.<br /><br />I normally wear red that has a little more blue in it, so was surprised that this clear red was fine for me. To me that says that it will flatter a wide range of skin tones.<br />After swiping it on my wrist and then wiping it away, it left a nice stain. If you aren't interested in that drop dead gorgeous look and want something a little more subtle, it does double duty by leaving a pinky red stain when blotted. But go for the high voltage dramatic red if you want to be noticed.<br /><br />Very comfortable lipstick, but I didn't have a problem with it bleeding. Non-drying and non-cracking. Opaque coverage with one swipe.<br />Another plus, it makes your teeth look super white.<br />I hope that this review as well as the photographs can help you to make a decision about this lipstick.

AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,"Very strong scent at first, but it disappears very quickly.","I really loved the idea of this Boiess Baby Cologne ""Les Enfants"" in White Blossom. Not because I think it is a good idea for a baby, because boy, is it not. I actually thought it would be perfect for myself since I don't like loud fragrances. The description of the scent profile really enticed me, as I love all of the notes. I was able to try both the Lavanda and the White Blossom scents.<br />Both of the ""Cologne"" sprays smell identical to me. I can't say that I can tell them apart at all. They both have a very strong earthy, herbal, slightly floral scent that is heavily ladened with alcohol upon spraying. It stays very strong for several minutes, but then starts to dry down.<br />Sadly, once it dries down, the scent pretty much dissipates. If I don't spray it heavily at first, which is too much for my asthma to handle, much less any baby, the scent just goes away completely. I must spray it on me again.

AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,Much more than just hyaluronic acid! Very moisturizing and best fitting for my face. 5 stars⭐,"I love these masks! For the price and how many you get, I was surprised to find the plastic backing. I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br />It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br />I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br />I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish. I usually discard the small pieces that cover the nose and upper lip. I then take those four pieces, put them back in the serum that's left in the package remoisten them, with these that is no problem, or just add a little hyaluronic acid serum to moisten them again, put them on my neck and decollete area the best I can, and wait another 15 or 20 minutes. This really lets me get the most possible use out of every mask.<br />I really love these masks and all of the skin loving ingredients they contain. They make my face feel wonderful afterwards and the effects last all day, if not longer. These are definitely on my must-have list. Highly recommend!",B08XZDXTG2,1620378771291,5.0
AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,"Somewhat good in theory, not so great in reality. 2.5 Stars ✨","This mirror really wants to be elegant looking. It has a pearlized finish with some elegant swirls at the top, but it really just looks like a plastic vanity mirror that should come with one of the Barbie mannequin heads that little girls put makeup on and do their hair.<br />The mirror has three light settings, bright white, really yellow, and I'm assuming a daylight, which is the only light I can somewhat see myself a little bit with it on. Really, it's just awful trying to see in this mirror with the light on. This is the first lighted mirror that I've experienced this with. For some reason, the light seems to shadow your face somehow, or either it's just the wrong color or brightness, and you can hardly see yourself in the mirror at all. And, no matter which mirror I want to look in, I have to pick the mirror up and bring it close to my face. And even then, I feel like I'm looking at light, and not my face being brightened by the light.<br />Also, once put together, the fold out mirrors do not stay flush when folded in. It gives it the look like you've broken it and are just living with it like that. And, I find the fold out mirrors very cumbersome to look at myself in them, with the light on or off. Especially the bottom one that has the most magnification, which really should have been on the top, in my opinion. If I don't pick it up, I have to bend way down to see in the bottom one, and then I can only see half of my face if the light is on. The other half is in a shadow, whether the light is on or off. The upper mirror is just as hard to see in, as my face is shadowed on one side very heavily if the light is on. It's just an awkward design.<br />This mirror seemed somewhat good in theory, but because of the very poor design and the lack of quality materials, it is rendered nearly useless. Each mirror, in and of itself, is nice and clear and seems great. One might think of recycling them, or a young girl may find better use of this vanity mirror as she's playing dress up, or learning to do makeup. For myself, because I cannot see into it with the lights on, as it's meant to be used, and I don't find it aesthetically pleasing to display, I will not be using it.",B08N6CLJ6P,1613555086658,3.0

They work great for making my witch hazel facial toner spray and colloidal silver spray. The sprayers work pretty well, although the sprayer part spins around freely. It makes them feel a little clumsy and uneasy to grab hold of. The price for these is on the high side of what I would normally pay for a set like this.

The ones for hand sanitizer can easily fit in my handbag and carry bag, and the ones for my facial care products fit nicely on the small caddy I have in my bathroom. They are easy to fill from my large pump containers, which is a plus. My only issue is that mine are missing the clips that go on them. It's not so terrible for the few that I use in my bathroom, but it is for the ones I use for hand sanitizer. It makes it harder to find them in my purse and bag.

I got this brush for her fine, curly hair.  She is a sweet little girl, but will ""bleat"" if she thinks you intend to hurt her and the first time I put a brush to her, she was shivering like I was going to do something bad to her.  I talked to her and took my time and by the time I was done, she was relaxed and let me work on her a little at a time.  My other furgirl is an older, rescued papillion and because her fur is straight with no undercoat, this brush works great on her.

Then applied the conditioner which is more of a deep inky blue.  The instructions said to leave it in for a few minutes. When I wash it out, my hair feels differently--it feels as though there's still something there on my hair, but deeply mixed in. It feels differently than when I use regular shampoo.<br />Anyway, I love what this does for my hair. It seems to brighten the light silver and darken the darker grey.

The Aoraem requires you to turn the entire top half of the unit to power it. That’s fine for turning it on, but when you try to turn it off, it can loosen the bottom tray and the particles spill out if you’re not careful.

To begin with, it arrived inside a clear bag with a silver tie, making me smile at the nice presentation. Being impressed with the packaging was nothing compared to the wonderful aroma that I was treated to when I peeked under the seal and looked at the product. It looked like whipped cream cheese and smelled good enough to eat! The scent is a combination of chocolate and mint. Taking just a tiny bit of the cream in my hands to feel it let me know why it is called velvet body cream. It truly does feel velvety, silky and soft.<br /><br />I was able to appreciate all of the above before I even tried the product. However, using the product is the real treat. This soft and silky cream is just fun to use. Getting out of the shower and dealing with dry skin in the winter is a pain and this product changes that. Instead of being in a hurry to get some lotion slathered on my skin so I can get dressed, I look forward to pampering myself with this product. I feels so good on my hands while I am applying it to my arms and legs. Of course it smells wonderful too but the really great part is how well it absorbs and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.<br /><br />If you are looking for a gift for a friend that complains of dry skin in the winter, look no further.

I has really good lather, a strong pump and a wonderful scent. It lathers easily and also rinses out easily. I like how my hair feels after using it. I am not so much of a fan of the conditioner. I was a bit surprised that after putting it in my hair, my hair did not feel slick like it does with most conditioners. It actually felt quite coarse. I always brush my hair while in the shower with the conditioner still in it. I attempted that with this conditioner and found that not only did the conditioner not do any untangling, but I got the brush stuck in my hair! I then rinsed and rinsed to get it all out and then tackled the knotted hair. My hair acted as if I had not had any conditioner at all and I had to fight my way through the knots. Once dry, my hair felt normal.<br /><br />I have ceased using the conditioner but I do like the affect of the purple shampoo on my salt and pepper hair.",B08QKXY1KN,1623276456190,3.0
AHGQDSOBAIVAAKJFIVEGS344MSXA,Wonderfully moisturizing,"Review for C'est Moi Vanilla Vibes Sugar Balm Body Scrub | Invigorating & Hydrating Exfoliant, Clinically Tested Non-Toxic Ingredients<br /><br />This is my kind of sugar scrub. It cleans and exfoliates while it also hydrates my skin. When I get out of the tub or shower I don’t have to apply lotion to my body because the scrub left my skin completely moisturized.<br /><br />The sugar in this product does the job of exfoliating and making the skin fresh and new. The oil in the product does the moisturizing, much better than just a lotion after because it really coats the skin.<br /><br />There will be some residue left in the tub or shower that has to be rinsed with really hot water when done or it will be slippery for the next shower or bath.<br /><br />Definitely a recommend for anyone that understands what this product is.",B07FPS2VFK,1619392919311,5.0

I spritzed some mist on our bedding about an hour before bedtime, and later the slight delicate fragrance was there in a relaxing sort of way.  Not powerful or too flowery for the guys, but a nice calm fresh and peaceful scent that was only minimally noticeable.

AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,not entirely convinced on how baby safe this is but maybe better for pre teens or adults,"I was curious about a perfume for baby because we've been taught not to use anything on the little ones except the gentlest of lotions and body wash. I decided to give this a try because I was curious about the scent and the execution of a product like this.<br /><br />First thing I did was smell this, and while it is a pleasant smell, this particular scent isn't my favorite. It is too floral for me, almost artificial. I may have liked and felt more comfortable using a citrus and fruity type of scent on my little one. I also looked at the ingredients list and while they may be free of parabens, phthalates, synthetic colors, dyes, GMOs, and Gluten Free, there are some potentially irritating ingredients for the very sensitive of skins. Ingredients like Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene can be an allergen. It may have prebiotics which is good but one good ingredient does not negate a potentially irritating one. I'm all for someone coming up with a safe and good cologne for baby but I'm not entirely sold on this product just yet. I did read up on some additional information but I need more convincing for me to be on board with this perfume for infants. I do love the story of why the founder wanted to create these scents for little ones but I'm just not fully on board with some of the ingredients used.<br /><br />I'm not sure I will be using this on my baby but I think a more appropriate age is pre-teen or teens. I may have been a little more open to a ""cleaner"" perfume for that age range as I'm sure there's a market for that. From what I read, the founder is going to be launching perfumes for that age group, so that might be more appropriate.<br /><br />My baby actually smells nice from good hygiene so he doesn't need anything else but I understand the concept behind these scents. Fragrances do invoke certain memories, just like music. There are certain scents that I get a whiff of and it immediately transports me back to that day, the person, or the memories of that particular time period. All that said, I will be holding off using perfume on my baby and will be spritzing this stuff on myself. I think the concept is great but I would like to see even ""better"" and cleaner ingredients if I am to use it on my baby.<br /><br />I didn't see the ingredients list posted on this Amazon page yet so here it is:<br />Ingredients:<br />Alcohol Denat., Aqua (Water), Parfum (Fragrance) Niacinamide, Glycerin, Lactitol, Xylitol, Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Gernaniol, Amyl Cinnamal, Limolene, Hydroxycitronellal.",B09G3KBK7Y,1645640209258,3.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,hours of fun,"I was going to save this as a Christmas gift for my nieces but just could not resist and had to give it to them early. They aren't allowed to go to a real nail salon/spa yet so I planned an at home ""spa day"" for them, with their mom's approval of course. The foot spa uses batteries so I was able to do this anywhere and not have to worry about being close to an outlet. However, that could also be a ""negative"" as you have to worry about replacing batteries. We always have plenty of batteries at home anyway for our gadgets so it wasn't an issue. They had to ""wait in line"" for their turn while I painted their toes and gave them a stack of magazines to flip through. It was such a fun experience for them without having to spend a fortune, and in the safety of our home. The foot spa machine itself is pretty cool, and is almost like the one I have for myself. I did use warm water - the machine doesn't heat up or anything, so make sure you use lukewarm water for the little feets! I went a step further and even gave them an exfoliating foot scrub which is something I already have at home for myself. This is honestly the best $40 spent - an experience like this in a ""real"" salon and spa would have easily cost more than $40 for two girls. The great thing about this is that it is a suitable item for a wide range of ages, even after they've entered their teen years. I highly recommend this set.",B0912BNP4J,1637268727025,5.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,you will see results if you commit to it,"I've been using this for 3 months now and I do think this works with longterm use. You obviously aren't going to see overnight results but if you keep at it you will notice a difference on your wrinkles. Luckily I don't have too many yet but I did use it on the little areas where I'm starting to see wrinkles. I noticed a tightening of the areas I used the laser on for the past 3 months. I really liked the hyaluronic acid serum that was included in the set - the serum felt gentle and has no smell (fragrance free). On some days where I didn't use the laser I would still use the serum to moisturize my face. I looked into purchasing just the serum, which they do have for sale, as I really like the product. The laser is easy to operate and charge (usb). I didn't use this daily as I wanted to give my skin a rest, but I think if you used this religiously then you would see results at a much faster rate. It isn't painful, but you feel a little zap. I would equate it to the same level of ""pain"" as a derma roller, that spikey/zappy feeling - not painful, not super uncomfortable. That of course, will depend on your skin sensitivity. I recommend using the lowest setting first then working your way up as your skin sensitivity will allow. Don't force your skin into what it cannot handle - listen to your body's reaction!<br /><br />I've seen so many of these laser type products for the skin/body, and never tried it because I didn't trust it. Nira is the first at home laser product that I decided to give a chance to, as I trust it. Overall I am not disappointed but do know that you need to commit to it if you want to see results. If you are going to use it once every few weeks then it will be a while before you see results, if ever. I plan to keep using this to stimulate my skin.",B08P2DZB4X,1635459121478,4.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,"amazed at the quality, design, and packaging of this brush set","[[VIDEOID:320116271bad63ca81ada02ccef2fa90]] This is the nicest packaged makeup brush set I've gotten on here so far. I don't mean beautiful packaging but the fact that they sterilized it and individually packaged the brushes in a sterile manner makes this product stand out from other brush sets. I prefer a clean, sanitized brush over a fancy box that I’ll end up throwing away. The price is also VERY reasonable for the quality of brushes I received. No, it is not high end brush quality but I'd rather get this starter set for $13 over one brush that would cost me $50-$80. I guess I'm not a makeup brush snob or a professional makeup artist so I just don't understand paying that much for a makeup brush. I thought these were great quality, the bristles are so soft, the color scheme is beautiful, and I love the plain matte handles. This one does not have any brand or printed words on the brush handles, which I haven't seen in a while. The brush sets I've gotten on here always has a brand stamp and sometimes they are a little corny sounding or tacky looking - this one is perfect. I thought the size of the brush is just right, good density - bottom line is I have no complaints about these! This is a set I would recommend getting. Don't let the price scare you off from thinking you are getting a bad quality brush set - it is better than I had expected.",B0919R1CYT,1624917504077,5.0

It also feels cool on the face, with or without any lotion/serum. You can make it even cooler by storing it in the fridge prior to use. I also had some tightness in my neck area and it worked great as a massager too. Very good quality roller, this is one I highly recommend!",B08RYN11N9,1624403169440,5.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,loving ayurvedic skincare,"After trying AAVRANI's exfoliator, I fell in love. I was excited to try their other products so this was a great kit for that without having to purchase the full size of each product. This came in a beautiful cardboard box, fancier than most trial kits.<br /><br />There are four products to try:<br />- restoring serum<br />- activating exfoliator<br />- softening hydra-wrap<br />- eye rejuvenating elixir<br /><br />My favorite is the hydra wrap and exfoliator.<br />The hydra wrap is quite moisturizing and rich without feeling heavy, nor did it feel sticky/tacky after applying. I could slightly feel it on my skin after applying but it wasn't greasy or uncomfortable. The exfoliator has little shea nut powder beads in it to help exfoliate and scrub, and has a thick consistency. It is like your typical face exfoliator except it has great, good for your skin, quality ingredients.<br /><br />The eye elixir is good and felt like a gentler/less rich moisturizer compared to the face cream.<br /><br />I didn't like the serum because of the consistency - it is too liquid-y for me, and is almost like a toner than your typical serum. It felt fine on the face but I just didn't like how runny it was. The dropper style dispenser is great but it was like dispensing toner.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed AAVRANI's product line. I'm actually surprised at the quality of the packaging for a trial set like this. It is just as luxurious as the full sized products. I feel bad that I'll just be discarding the bottle/packaging after use. AAVRANI products products smell nice (some are even fragrance free as I didn't smell any fragrance) and nothing felt sticky/tacky or uncomfortable on my skin. I have been loving a lot of these ayurvedic based skincare brands as they seem to use better, cleaner, and gentler ingredients. If you are looking for something like that, do give AAVRANI a try - it is good stuff. I am saving this set to bring with me on weekend getaways.",B0949MJRHK,1623906196087,5.0

That said, this product is my favorite from BeautyStat. This is one I would be repurchasing once I am done with this bottle. I loved how it felt on my skin, and although it is a ""face oil"", did not leave my skin a greasy mess. My skin soaked it up soon after applying and just made it feel nice and moist. It just feels very light and will not feel like it is ""weighing"" down your skin like some heavy oils can do. It feels very gentle and I did not experience any itchiness or irritation. There is no scent to this, and is just 100% pure Squalane. If you are wanting to try this brand but not sure which product to get first, I would say get THIS.",B08RRSPNWV,1622704719036,5.0

For the longest time my facial “sunscreen” was just to avoid the sun, stay in the shade. That is still my mantra, but occasionally when I know I’ll be in the sun I put on a good Asian sunscreen - because they tend to uncheck all the boxes of the things I mentioned above. That said, this is another sunscreen I am adding to my collection. It did not feel uncomfortable on my skin and did not leave any white cast or blotches. It absorbed pretty quickly and my skin didn’t feel tacky. Also, this is SPF 50! All in all, this is another Asian facial sunscreen that I am adding to my “loves” list.",B08NJ5BTWG,1617975142734,5.0

This is very good to have if you use a lot of lotion and don’t need much to glide while you’re massaging. It’s a bit thick for my liking so a small amount can go a long ways, which is good if you’re trying to make this lotion last you a long time.<br />Doesn’t seem to clogged my pores specially in my back where I get pimples so that’s a good thing. For the price this is a good buy.<br />No skin irritation experience so that’s a good thing.<br />Beside the texture, I am happy with the overall experience with this lotion.",B08N5NDVGH,1649952052883,4.0

AGZYMSCZZ5SPWHX5AVWTP64TY7AA,Love how clear the mirror is!,This took more than a month to arrived but I’m glad I waited. This looks exactly as advertised and my favorite is the mirror! The mirror looks very clear and is easy to clean.<br />I got this to use not only to keep my simple makeup stuff but also to use for my channel.<br />Is $22 worth it? I honestly think it is too much but if you want convenience of finding a simple sweet gift to give to your girl friend/daughter/sister this makes it worth it.<br />The makeup bag can be flimsy if you have nothing heavy or flat to keep in the bottom and the zipper is a bit thin and I wish it’s thicker or better than what they use BUT at least the bag looks exactly as what is pictured in their listings so I cannot omit a star coz of that.<br />Also this is packed really well in a box so if you’re planning to gift this to someone directly from Amazon then you don’t need to wrap it.,B092M5K59T,1638397232966,5.0

The product is good and is fun to use with my niece when I have them with me.<br />The foot spa is easy to operate and makes your little girl feel extra special.<br />The items that comes with it is cute BUT the slippers are super thin/flimsy and slippery so be very careful if you plan to use them around wet areas/tile floors.<br />This uses a battery and will cost you more than the unit over time, if you use the rechargeable kind then you may not be able to use it longer (spa time wise)<br />Overall the product is good and exactly as described!",B0912BNP4J,1637016949727,4.0

The letterings are good and no smudges. The lid closes nicely and the straw fits perfectly. My only wish is the bottom of the tumbler have nonskid bottom but even without this stays in place without issues.<br />The soap, bath bombs and the candle smells really good and doesn’t irritate my skin and nose.<br />The wine topper and the key is cheap looking but I guess it’s the thought that counts.<br />It maybe a bit pricey, but the convenience it gives you pays for it.",B09GVHT2D3,1635349666253,5.0

I got this mostly to hold hand sanitizers for my whole family so we have our own when we are out.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* perfect size! If you will travel for a week, this will be enough to hold your stuff.<br />* the silicone material is very nice, I am very impressed!<br />* wide mouth<br />* easy to refill and get your stuff out<br />* the carabiners are made of high quality metal.<br />* easy to squeeze (but be careful if it’s a hand sanitizer or water like liquid it will come out very fast so squeeze with caution)<br /><br />CONS<br />* The scent of whatever you put leaks out. You will need a a few ziplock bags to contain the scent if you are traveling or else it will be all over your luggage. If you happen to mix it with food items, expect it to taste whatever you put on this bottles.<br />* don’t use for hand sanitizers or anything with alcohol base on it. I got it mainly for holding hand sanitizers for my whole family but the scent leaks so bad that I have to not use it for the purpose. It is also not good when squeezing coz it will not give you little amount.<br />* some liquid leaks too.<br /><br />This product will be good for lotion, toothpaste or shampoo/conditioner coz they have thicker consistency. But be aware that scents leaks. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because I can’t use it for the purpose I got it for (hand sanitizers)<br />If you plan to use it thicker liquids and don’t mind the scent leaks then this is perfect coz the silicone material is very nice.",B08HRHCZV2,1605577272223,3.0
AECTRGMRKOGAYIV3YXX73CQEQCSQ,"Vintage style, timeless color","I'm a big fan of the style of this brand and have been for years. There's something about the vintage aesthetic that they capture so perfectly that always draws me in. I wasn't sure what I would think about their actual lipsticks however because of the bullet style is so unusual, but I really love this. The formula is creamy but long-lasting and even leaves a little bit of a stain, and the color is just the perfect red in my opinion it's a slightly deeper red so it feels a little more sophisticated and a little more wearable than a brighter red. It also has a slight blue base to it which makes your teeth look a little wider. The packaging is absolutely lovely and I actually find that I really enjoy the style of the lipstick bullet. I still always wear a lip liner of course but the angle of this makes it really easy to fully coat your lips. I will absolutely be buying more lipsticks from this brand.",B005AL5H9S,1644173335551,5.0
AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,Product doesn’t say it is Vegan : (,"The listing says the product is Vegan but nowhere on the box or product does it state that.  I am not a scientist so am unsure if it truly is.  My experience – especially with most beauty products – is that if they are Vegan they definitely like to tout it on the product.  I am going to assume it is – but it should still say it clearly on it...<br /><br />It is black – so it is definitely “a look” for most people.  If you are goth or something – you will probably love it.  I got it mostly for Halloween.  Especially as it is matte – I can use it on my face as a whole to help with my costume– and not just on my lips.  It is easy to apply and actually applied VERY precisely.  If you wear it alone it is sort of dry on the lips – but not as dry as some others out there.  I like to add a slight layer of a balm first – just to give me some hydration.  It still comes off very matte that way but maybe doesn’t wear as well for longevity.  Even then – it didn’t come off on my teeth – just slightly on a cup I was drinking out of.  Not terrible at all though.  It has a slightly vanilla like scent to it.  It is pretty nice.  It sort of stayed put but was also easy enough to wipe off with a paper towel and some pressure.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks!

AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,"Decent enough box of goodies - was expecting more from it, though","This is cute enough and I am sure if you gave it as a gift a recipient would be appreciative.  I have a problem in that NONE of the contents have ingredients listed, though.  So, although the soap looks beautiful and fancy – I do not know what is in it or what it is made of.  Same goes for the bath bombs – no ingredients whatsoever.  (One I like the smell of – the other not so much.)  Because of this these items definitely come off dollar store-like.  The wine tumbler seems well made and comes with a straw and straw brush.  The candle says it is soy wax which is nice but to me it smells terrible.  The weird part is that the gift box comes with a plastic wine topper.  Now the wine bottle topper “looks” nice but it is 100% plastic – worse than dollar store...  It also comes with what looks like a random decorative metal key that serves no function and does not go with the contents at all.  Yet it is a bottle top opener – for beer…  That is so weird to me and I will be taking this out before gifting this gift set as no wine I know of has a pop top – twist off sure – but beer cap?  For the price, they need to truly step it up in regards to the contents - include ingredients and include a better wine stopper.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

I just didn't notice much of a flavor at all and the texture was more like an oil which drove me nuts throughout the day. I kept worrying about it sliding around and moving my lip color underneath. I personally prefer a more sticky gloss. I did like how fine the glitter was so it didn't bother my lips or create any tingling effect.

When the temperatures got to the hundreds here I was reaching for this all day. I used it not only my face but my neck and shoulders and it was absolutely heavenly.<br />I personally love the extra long handle so I don't apply too much pressure when rolling away.

Not only do they pack light - I can stick one little tin in my bag and it takes up almost no space at all, but the sheets themselves are tiny.

There was no cumulative improvement at all. It seems to be very watered down and you are paying for a lot of filler content and very little active ingredient which is probably why it didn't work.<br /><br />Overall it seems that you are definitely paying for the packaging and the ""male"" appeal.

Also the card is inside the box - so if you had it shipped to you to give to someone you would still have to open it in order to fill it out.<br /><br />Overall - this is on sale at the time of the review for under $20 and for that price it is definitely worth it.

AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,"Soft & smooth, lightweight matte lip cream that doesn't dry out the lips 💋","PeriPera is kinda known for having amazing lip tints & stains. When I saw that they were offering lipstick bullets now, I thought these would have that same effect. I was mistaken. This is a soft textured matte lip cream developed to attain the look of blurred lips, a popular Korean beauty trend. What exactly does ""blurred lips"" translate to in the West? It means skip the harsh lip liner & soften the edges of your lip borders. The goal is to achieve a gradual gradient of color.<br /><br />I got shade n°8 ""City Pop Chili"", which I would describe as a burnt brick red color. It feels very Autumnal and will be best complemented by those with warm skintones.<br /><br />The texture of the lip cream itself is soft & smooth, sorta like a mousse. It's very lightweight, easy to blend, and feels comfortable on the lips. It has a matte finish, with just the right amount of moisturizing properties to keep it from completely drying out my lips.<br /><br />I found that it's best to apply this product straight from the tube. I tried to build up opacity by using a lip brush to apply it, but every time I'd swipe the brush across my lips, it would actually remove product and leave bald spots. The formula isn't as long wearing as I was expecting from a matte lipstick, either. After a couple hours of eating, drinking, and expressive mouth movements, the color wears off entirely and I have to reapply. I really wish this wore down to a stain, but that's not what PeriPera was going for.<br /><br />The frosted, translucent pink lipstick component used for this line of lippies is understated, but pretty. It looks very feminine. The actual lipstick bullet has a slim silhouette and an angled tip. You get exactly one inch of visible product inside the tube. This formula is free of fragrance. There is no scent at all that I can detect.<br /><br />Expiration date printed on my product packaging is Aug. 2024<br />(2 years & 10 months from when I purchased it in Oct. 2021)<br /><br />Full Ingredients:<br />Dimethicone, Dibutyl Adipate, Microcrystalline Wax, Polyethylene, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Ceresin, Iron Oxide Red, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Agave Tequilana Leaf Extract, Diglyceryl Sebacate/Isopalmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Silica, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Butylene Glycol, Water, BHT, Fragrance, Lithol Rubine BCA, Sunset Yellow FCF, Brilliant Blue FCF, Tartrazine",B09HMXY36F,1637619946800,4.0
AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,My skin went from dry/dehydrated to oily after using this toner 😔,"The sedum extract in this essence was quite intriguing to me.  As someone with chronically dry, sometimes dehydrated skin I thought this toner could help me.  ""Sedum is a succulent leaf known for its intense hydration, vitamins & mineral level.  It holds more hydration than watermelon and is rich in phytoestrogen that further boosts hydration and improves the skin condition.""  When I read that, I thought this sounded like the recipe for perfect skin, but every time I use this essence my face turns super oily.  I have never experienced this kind of change from any of the hydrating essences I own.<br /><br />The scent on this is light, clean, and fresh, very herbal.  You should be aware that this product is fragranced with natural fruit oils & extracts.  A few minutes after application though, the scent dissipates quickly.  My skin is crazy reactive & very sensitive, but I did not experience any adverse reactions to the ingredients used in this essence.<br /><br />There was also a generous amount of samples from Celimax included with this toner.  😀  They sent 2 Noni ampoules, 3 serum packettes, and 2 AHA/BHA exfoliating/brightening pads (labeled for underarms, but can be used elsewhere).  Korean brands are so very gracious with samples!  Thank you, Celimax! ❤<br /><br />Both the package & bottle both come safety sealed.  The bottle is of nice size (150ml) and features a shaker style spout for easy dispensing.  I pour a small amount of the essence into my hands, then pat into the skin after cleansing. Then I apply my serums & moisturizer.<br /><br />Though I don't find this product to be a particularly good fit for my skin right now (during the hot & humid Florida summer heat, when my oil production is already at it's peak), I think this essence may work better for me in the winter.  I do think it's a nice product, so it still gets a 4 star rating from me.",B084WP4XS8,1623199074646,4.0

AEZG2W4TRMMNFFAWS2BPQE676K4Q,"Pretty Simple To Use, Stings A Little, No Issues So Far, Awaiting Potential Results","So far, I have no real complaints about this NIRA Skincare Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum Bundle. I’m still at the point where I’m not sure if I can say it truly works because I need to use it for a longer period of time, but I’ll discuss various aspects about the product that will hopefully help with your decision-making.<br /><br />-Came well-packaged in a small, but sturdy cardboard box. Everything arrived intact. I have continued to use this box for storage of the product.<br />-Comes with the handheld laser device, charger with base to plug into an outlet, and manual<br />-No complaints about the battery life so far<br />-Simple to use: there are two buttons: The power button that turns the device on. Then you can press it to cycle through the various levels of intensity 1-5 which are clearly shown using green light bars. You can then hold the power button down to turn the device off again. The top button can be pressed to activate the laser after you have chosen the level of intensity you want.<br />-The laser only works if positioned correctly over an area of skin. It will give a single negative sounding beep if not positioned correctly, and a positive sounding double beep if it is positioned correctly as the laser works. You wait to move the device to the next area after you hear that second beep indicating that it is finished with that laser sequence<br />-The device has a white, plastic outer shell. It is lightweight while still feeling sturdy and durable. I would still be very careful not to drop this as I’m not sure how it could handle a fall<br />-I would recommend experimenting on the lower intensity settings. The undereye area is pretty sensitive. I feel I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but my eyes often still tear up after using per instructions on the highest settings of 4 and 5. For whatever reason, my left eye is much more sensitive to this.<br />-I don’t want to say it is truly painful, but I suppose the best way to describe the sensation is almost similar to if you were being stung by a rubber band that you pulled back and let hit your skin if that makes sense. It isn’t comfortable, but you do get more used to this and can work your way up to a higher level of intensity. You will probably also feel some warmth on the skin after using.<br />-I know this is marketed for under the eyes, but I have also been using on my forehead and by my smile lines.<br /><br />***The instruction manual is pretty clear and straightforward. You definitely need to read this before getting started. Here is some information that you can find within the manual:<br /><br />-They say all skin tones and anyone over the age of 12 can use NIRA to reduce the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes<br />-You need to clean and dry your face just prior to using NIRA<br />-It can be using morning or night and up to twice daily. They recommend waiting 1 minute before retreating each area and not to treat more than twice within a 1-hour period.<br />-Do not treat the same spot twice in a row, even if the pulse is rejected and you get the low pitched, negative sounding beep<br />-The instructions clearly show you the recommended way to treat the undereye area and the treatment pattern to use<br />-They recommend using the highest power level where you feel warmth without pain<br />-You should use a facial moisturizer after each treatment and a daily sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is recommended. This bundle includes the hyaluronic acid serum which can also be used.<br />-Device should be kept clean and free of dust, especially the glass lens which can be cleaned with a cotton swab. Surfaces can be cleaned with 70% alcohol solution between each use.<br />-They say some potential side effects include: skin warmth, redness, and stinging. Less frequent side effects include dryness, roughness, tanned appearance to skin, swelling, flaking, itching, crusting, bruising, pimple-like rash, irritated skin, blistering, scarring, infection, and skin color changes where your skin may become darker or lighter. I have only experienced the temporary warmth and stinging during use- no redness or anything else.<br />-The company also cautions those who have skin conditions or are undergoing professional cosmetic treatments such as injectable toxins like Botox or fillers- saying to check with your doctor or clinician prior to using NIRA.<br />-Only use on intact skin<br />-Don’t use if pregnant or nursing or undergoing fertility treatments<br />-Do not use if you have a history of skin cancer, any other cancer, or pre-malignant moles<br />-Do not treat if you have tanned skin which is apparently at increased risk of adverse effects with light-based devices<br /><br />Overall, I’m happy with how the product functions and the ease of use. I will continue using and will update if I have any further comments or concerns. I haven’t noticed any real results yet, but I also haven’t been using it that long. One question that comes to mind is this: What is the lifespan of this device? Months? Years? Or does it give out after firing the laser a certain number of times? I could have missed it in the manual, but that is something I’m still not sure of. For the current price of $329, that is something I think people may want to know. I haven’t had any issues with the serum that comes in this package, but it seems pretty simple and basic.",B08P2DZB4X,1639396471514,4.0
AEZG2W4TRMMNFFAWS2BPQE676K4Q,"No Fragrance, Moisturizing, Not The Greatest Value-Improvements Could Be Made","These Doctor Babor Hyaluronic Acid Serum Power Serum Ampoules seem pretty good. I definitely like this better than their collagen concentrate ampoules, but there are things that could have been changed to make me like this product a lot more.<br /><br />-Received 7 glass ampoules with 2ml of product inside each one<br />-Well presented in a nice looking silver display box<br />-You have to snap the glass ampoules open. They do provide a plastic cylindrical piece to aid in doing so. I’m a nurse, so I’m used to breaking open these kinds of ampoules without any issue. I can imagine that some people would not like this though<br />-Watery serum that glides across skin easily<br />-Honestly, a little seems to cover a large area of skin. 2ml may not seem like a lot, but a single ampoule seems like way more than would be needed for one application. I have split one into 3-4 uses to be honest<br />-I’m assuming the company intends for one whole ampoule to be used as one application because each one is labeled as day 1-7, and they provide no way to seal an ampoule back after using which I found to be rather frustrating<br />-Absorbs rapidly and doesn’t feel sticky or tacky after drying like the collagen concentrate did<br />-Their collagen concentrate ampoules also had a heavy fragrance, so I was SO relieved to find that there is no added fragrance with these<br />-Made in Germany<br /><br />So does it really help with plumping, smoothing, and reducing wrinkles? I don’t know. I definitely like the way my skin looks and feels right after application, but I haven’t noticed anything drastic.<br />As I previously stated, the 2ml of serum feels like A LOT to me if you try to put it all on your face at once. Unfortunately, this company also does not provide a way to seal an individual ampoule back for future use since they apparently intend for one ampoule to be an entire application. I remember I tried a set by the ISDIN brand with glass ampoules just like these. In the kit, the company included a top to slide over the opened glass ampoule with a cap to seal for future use. This was awesome and so convenient. I was disappointed to find out that this company did not include anything like that (I took a picture of that top and cap on one of these ampoules so you can see).<br /><br />Anyway, it is possible that this product may provide good results when used long term, but I just don’t really like this being intended for use over 7 days only. If they included a top with cap to seal each individual ampoule so that the product could be used over a longer period of time, I would like it much more. I would definitely prefer a serum in a larger bottle with dropper lid.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know – thanks! I’ll be sure to update if I have any other comments to add.",B08VQY1Z1S,1625107342095,4.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Nice size. Easy operation. Effective curling function. 👍👍,"Of course the first thing that the significant other noticed about the product is the pink coloring. She said it goes perfectly with her other hair/beauty products.  So, already it has a head start.<br />It comes inside a nice, somewhat snug drawstring bag. This is useful for transporting the curling device. And, yes, the compact size makes it very sensible to pack for remote (away from home) usage.  Another key aspect of the product is wireless operation. Evidence: she comments that not having to worry about wires or being close to the wall outlet is fantastic. And, not dealing with power cords means better time efficiency.<br />Operation is fairly easy. A long press of the power button turns it on. When you press the power button again, you advance to a feature you can alter/select, with that aspect blinking. For example, the ""R"" might be blinking. You use the +/- button to change it to ""L"" (R and L indicate the curling direction, creating right or left curls). In this manner, you can change the direction, temperature and timer.  The display also shows the battery power status.  When the curler device has reached proper temperature, it beeps. You can then insert a small section of hair. Curling appearance/tightness will depend on hair texture, temperature and time of treatment.<br />The battery capacity is rated at 5000mAh. It takes 3 - 4 hours to fully charge a depleted battery. This affords 4 - 6 hours of continuous operating time.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the wireless hair curling device, with a ruler for size reference. Close ups of the display, with varying settings, is provided to some of the selection options.<br />The significant other gives it two thumbs up with a smile.  👍👍  😄  Accordingly, it earns a 4.5+ star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",B09G22586Y,1644453687341,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,"Fantastic, amply powered nano mist sprayer/spritzer. Not just water.","At first, the significant other wondered why this was larger than other nano mist sprayers that we own. Then I explained that those other sprayers restrict the liquid to water, and some require distilled water. This fine mist sprayer is described as being akin to an airbrush. ""Works with serum, water-soluble toner, lotion, milk or mineral water for care spa. Not only the skin on the face, it also can be used for the maintenance of body and hair, anti-static and moisturizing."" That perked up her ears, and she said, ""Wow, yeah?""<br />She took the product, after the review photos, and charged the internal battery. A fully charged battery can provide up to an hour of continuous use. Not too shabby.<br />Her report was all favorable. She was amazed at the power, it was noticeably stronger than any of the other nano mist sprayers. We weren't fully sure about the oxygen/hyperbaric process, but she felt the misting was much more effective and efficient.<br />I asked if the size bothered her. She said, no. it's a worthwhile tradeoff, the power and efficacy (as measured by only one application) outweighs the increase in size. Further, she said that this is how mist sprayers should be. You should be able to put any liquid inside the reservoirs, and get a nano/fine misting. Almost all the nano sprayers just allow water. This product doesn't just 'wet' your face, it allows an actual treatment. And that's what is important.<br />And, in terms of size and portability, she said it's well within reason to carry around. But, for the most part, she thinks most will keep/use this at home. And, take it along with other sundry cosmetics when traveling or for special purposes.<br />So, the verdict is that this is a significant upgrade for the product genre. It delivers on the statements in the product details, matching the pictures and description in the product details.  I feel it meets, perhaps surpasses, her expectations of a nano mist sprayer. Based on these initial impressions and performance, this product earns a 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",B09671G4KH,1627259240050,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Attractive. Excellent construction. Smooth rolling action.,"This facial massage roller is exactly as shown in the product details. The roller is composed of quality materials and manufacture. While they give instructions for cooling therapy, by placing it in the fridge, it can also be used for warming application. I use a heating pad or heated gel pack to envelop the massage tool (specifically the rollers). This warms the metal roller sufficiently to afford a warming massage.<br />The one minor issue is the brand name emblazoned on the handle. I would have preferred a solid purple coloring on the handle. This is shown in the pictures in the product details, so this issue won't affect the rating. However, I do feel it's too large, conspicuous on the handle.<br />The significant other still uses this with the rollers at ambient temperature or cooled. However, she does like it when I warm the rollers and apply a massage to the back and sides of the neck.<br />Overall, this metal facial massage roller is exactly as shown and described in the product details. It's well made, durable and attractive. It meets expectations, earning a 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",B08RYN11N9,1624888732014,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Very nice design/form. Easy base top connection. Provides USB ports.,"This is a surprising UV curing lamp. It has a minor elaboration of the conventional design, allowing for a slightly wider opening, but still having a multi=angle lamp placement. 72 Watts is not the most powerful UV rating for this gel curing/drying lamp, but is more than ample power to do the job in reasonably quick time.<br />That said, I believe that this UV lamp actually normally will output 36W, unless you specifically activate the ""Double Power"" setting. To do this, you select one of the 3 'regular' timers: 10S, 30S or 60S (S = seconds). This sets the timing for the lamp operation. If you then press the last button, which is also the 99S ""Lowe Heat Mode"" button, and hold for about 3 seconds, it will activate the lamp into 72W...double the power. Thus the regular default UV setting is 36W.  If you press the 99S button, the UV power will gradually increase over the 99 seconds.<br />The device also has a sensor to turn the system on/off depending if it senses hand/foot in the cavity. If you need more time, just hit one of the timer buttons again.<br />There is no power on/off button. Once you plug the power adapter in, the unit is 'on' and ready to go, once you set timer and insert your fingers.<br />While the opening is wider than most other UV lamps, it's still a tight fit for both hands. But, I appreciate the slight elaboration of the cavity opening.<br />One new design element that I truly appreciate is the method to connect the top and base. There are small posts with magnets atop them. These magnetically attach to corresponding screws in recessed holes. So, it takes minimal effort to separate them, but easily hold together. Other lamps have a tab in slot method that sometimes is difficult to unlock or match up easily to attach. This improvement is a smart innovative upgrade.<br />Another innovation is the inclusion of USB-A and USB-C ports, located about the power plug port. Both of these USB ports are rated at only 5V 2A. So check the usb specs of any device you connect to these USB charging ports. But, it's a nice addition, anyway. It is a handy port to connect a nail dust fan, or nail drill.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with close-ups to highlight features.<br />On my wish list is a separate power on/off button, and while the display is view-oriented for the person inserting fingers, it would make sense to have the timer buttons oriented in the same manner. I think most people purchasing these lamps are DIY nail artists. It's not too difficult to manage the timer buttons, but it would just be simpler and common sense to have these controls positioned for easy operation by the user. These issues apply to all the UV lamps that I've encountered. It's a personal perspective/opinion, and does not affect the ratings of this device.<br />So, this UV curing lamp is default 36W, with the capability of user option to double power to 72W. It has a nice design and improved magnetic connection for top and base.  it's a very capable and competent device.<br />Accordingly, it earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",B08MT8L5ZL,1613265469654,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Perfect size. Excellent silicone squeeze bottle with mini-carabiner.,"This set of 6 soft squeeze silicone bottles, with mini-carabiner (ok, they're not actually carabiners; they're belt clips, but similar to being small carabiners, allowing you to secure the bottle to backpacks, belt loops, etc). The bottles come with 3 in clear, 1 blue, 1 green and 1 pink. It's a good mix, and the clear probably being the most versatile, since you'll be able to view the quantity and more easily identify the contents.<br />The silicone appears to be very good quality, is soft enough to easily squeeze, but firm enough to retain it's shape. Plus the tactile qualities of the silicone is very nice. The screw cap has a hinged topper that has a plug that fits snugly into the spout. The cap screws onto a hard plastic threaded piece. It's a relatively simple design that just works well.<br />Using plain water as a test, there was not a single drop of leakage. A very good sign. I did not abuse the bottle, and I'm sure that with enough pressure on the silicone bottle the cap could open, or there could be a leak. But, under normal circumstances I don't see leaks happening.<br />These are ideal to keep handy good quantities of hand sanitizer, hand lotion, creams, essential oils. I like the idea of the belt clip and the general design of the bottle.<br />Examination of the bottles found uniform construction, with no defects or flaws. These are cute and functional.<br />These silicone squeeze bottles earn a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",B08HRHCZV2,1610165574675,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Great amber glass spray bottles. Exactly as described and shown.,"These are excellent amber colored glass spray bottles. The capacity of each bottle is 16 ounces. Keep in mind that this is glass, not plastic. There are inherent advantages to using glass, such are durability and environmental concerns. Also, glass will not chemically interact with most liquids (however, caution is still necessary since the spray top and mechanism is composed of plastic). The disadvantage is that this kind of glass bottle is heavier than comparative plastic bottles. The amber color protects the contents from light (sunlight and uv exposure). My view is this type of spray bottle is more on the premium end of the scale.<br />Included accessories: 4 regular screw on tops, 1 screw on eye dropper top, funnel, labels and marker. Each of the bottles comes with the plastic spray top already installed. I appreciate the regular tops, which effect a better seal than the spray tops, which will protect the contents from spills, evaporation and contaminants. I wish they provided at least 2 of the eye dropper tops, but I guess even getting one, when the the product is sold as spray bottles, is a bonus.<br />The sprayer mechanism can actually rotate, it's not a one piece sprayer top, the screw on segment is separate from the spraying segment. This is not a cheap spraying cap.<br />The set of 4 amber color glass bottles fully matches the descriptions and pictures in the product details. At $34, these are a bit pricey, but the glass is substantial, not thin.<br />Overall, these are impressive, and appear to be a premium variation of spray bottle. And priced accordingly.<br />These spray bottles receive a solid 4.5 star rating.",B08HGZXLP6,1610068366632,5.0
AE3UKETTR77J4LM2ZE4AEUC4L6KA,Beautiful ❤️,This color is absolutely beautiful!!!! It glides on so smoothly and I love that it matches vintage colors.

AHOYQ263ZGBZIBPQGKNVAWG35DNQ,"Silky Smooth, Smells Wonderful","I tried this specifically because of the name, but was prepared to be disappointed. ""Citrus Souffle"" sounds almost too good to be true.<br /><br />But it's not. First, the scent. I get migraines, and scents are a trigger. Citrus, eucalyptus, and peppermint are OK - perfumes or manufactured fragrances have become a big ""no"" for me. Since a side effect is an extra sensitive sense of smell (which means things I put on my face have to be tolerated), I gravitate towards those I can tolerate. Sometimes even scents I usually like go awry in plastic containers or in a specific cosmetic mix. But this citrus is lovely. Limes, oranges, lemons, all rolled into one. A veritable orchard from this single cream. Wonderful.<br /><br />And the cream? So light, silky smooth, and creamy. From trying other creams, I know that if there's any chance the product will be slow to absorb, that will happen with my skin. This cream was quick to absorb, not heavy or weighing down, and left my skin feeling moisturized, refreshed, and as velvety soft as the cream itself.<br /><br />I'm also delighted that this product complies with the Australian SafeCosmetics Toxic Free Campaign and is listed as a participating vendor. Safer for me, safer for the environment in which we live. Great product, one I enjoy using.",B009GPP546,1648747013639,5.0
AHOYQ263ZGBZIBPQGKNVAWG35DNQ,Does What It Says.,"In this world of hyperbole, particularly in the cosmetic industry, it's rare that you find something that does exactly what it says. And when I tried this product I stood in the mirror looking at my laugh lines with a particularly jaundiced view. Only to be proven wrong.<br /><br />This product minimized my laugh lines. After two squeezes. You get three little dots on the brush with each squeeze, brush those on with the applicator, and wow.<br /><br />Having said that, it is a primer - so it doesn't provide all over color. It does brighten your skin - because it's white - and it does tighten. And you have to be careful (or at least, I have to be careful) not to get it near your eyes or mouth, where lots of lines are, because it tastes dreadful and I'm sure it's not designed for eyes. But it certainly works a miracle.<br /><br />In the past, I've used a clear primer with a bit of a tan color. No more. This is my new daily. I'm hooked.",B0977LVHF8,1631294260133,5.0
AHOYQ263ZGBZIBPQGKNVAWG35DNQ,Love this Hydration!,"I really love this hydrating and moisturizing product.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I would at first. Although the box is in English, and has clear instructions and ingredients, the product itself lacks those things. Celimax comes in a streamlined bottle that looks like mineral water. Aside from the general disaster that could pose with small children, the FDA requires cosmetic products sold in the USA list their ingredients on the bottle in English.<br /><br />The ingredients, by the way, which I wish Amazon would leave a spot for cosmetic vendors to include in their listings, so we would know before we order in case of allergies, are Sedum Sarmentosum, Butylene Glycol, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide NP, Xylityglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Dipotassium Glycrrhizate, Citrus Tangerina Peel Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, Glucose, Phospholifpids, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Caprylic/Capric Triclyceride, Ammonium Acryloylidimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-13 Pareth-9, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin.<br /><br />Having said that, I poured a little bit of the product onto a cotton pad in the evening and dabbed it onto my face, and onto the back of my hands. It initially felt just  a bit tacky, but almost immediately absorbed. I followed up on my face with my nightly cream. My face this morning feels AMAZING. The moisture level is through the roof.<br /><br />I also want to mention fragrance. Like 95% of chronic migraine headache sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell. Anything cosmetic that has perfume (think lip smackers) or added scent has the potential to make me nauseous and bring on a migraine. This had just a faint authentic citrus smell, vaguely pleasant, which thankfully disappeared within a few seconds of hitting the cotton ball. That kind of fragrance is ideal.<br /><br />And the effects are just amazing. I don't see my face all day, but I can sure see my hands on the keyboard. My hands are visibly more plumper, less dry, and  more hydrated. I am loving this product. Hopefully they're in process with getting their bottle properly labelled and safe for distribution in the United States, because this is my new routine. Such results!",B084WP4XS8,1623170705691,5.0
AGXMWJK3YL4SV5FJ27JEJZPZHRBA,Gel Mold Remover - Doesn't work so well,The order comes with one (1) mold remover that comes in a bottle. it comes with a cone shaped cap that you replace so you can dispense the mold remover gel. It allows for you to get to the corners and edges where the mold builds up and it's hard to scrub unless you have a thin brush to work with.<br /><br />The gel is clear and you squeeze the bottle for it to come out. It's pretty much the gel sitting on top of a molded sealant in my showers that is supposed to slowly kill the mold and you remove it by wiping it down a few hours later. The gel clumps and it stays there. I have seen it work slowly but it does not remove much of the built up mold.,B09TTC9Q9W,1655153976115,2.0

The eyeliner has dual tips on both ends, which provides a selection of either the felt or brush tips. Both brushes have fine tips so it's good for drawing precised lines. It glides on pretty easily. I do need to apply a couple layers because it applies pretty thinly. Also, the color can sometimes thin out and it not completely jet balck unless you press down on it.",B09LWV3HH2,1647272369172,4.0

All of the brushes are very soft but I do wish there were some firmer ones to be used for my lips or eyebrow. So far, none of the bristles have fallen out and remain in good shape. It would be nice if it came with a travel case that held all the brushes. It's a great brush set for anyone.",B0919R1CYT,1625948940671,4.0
AGXMWJK3YL4SV5FJ27JEJZPZHRBA,Quality Face Roller/Massager - Good Weight,The Sand & Sky Face Roller/Massager Tool comes in a beautiful package. The face massager tool is made out of metal and has a good weight compared to the plastic ones I've used in the past. There are two twin balls that you roll across your face.  They pull and push gently against your skin as you roll. It's an intersting sensation. These balls are also made out of metal and provides this cool sensation on your skin.<br /><br />I use the tool after the base of my skin care routine is applied. It helps my skin absorb without me having to pat on it numerous times. The face roller also helps sculpt your face but also get circulation flowing on your face without having to go visit a massage salon.,B08RYN11N9,1625800228958,5.0

AGXMWJK3YL4SV5FJ27JEJZPZHRBA,"Lightweight, High Absorption, Moisturizing Essence for Foundation of Skin Care Routine","The Celimax The Real Sedum Aqua Boosting Essence comes in a clear bottle of 150ml. It's a good size bottle that will probably will probably last me 9-10 months. The packaging is attractive and highly simple and modern. There's almost no scent to the essence, maybe a very faint scent of citrus if I were to pinpoint, which is ideal for people who have sensitive nose.<br /><br />I am not a chemist so the ingredients described have no meaning to me. Though, the essence contains hyaluronic acid which is the main ingredient in the toner that I use for final stage of my daily facial cleaning process. The toner is a lot thicker in content and leaves my skin sticky whereas this essence is very water based and feels amazing after applying. My skin reacted and absorbed the essence right away and left my skin smooth and moisturized without feeling any stickiness. Even my hands got moisturized and I do not have to wipe or wash away after the application. I learned through reading the product description that this essence contains low molecular weight hyaluronic acid, which with its small molecular structure makes it easier for it to absorb into the skin. This speaks true to the application because I use the essence right after I wash my face and this sets the base for my skincare routine and helps maxmize the absorbtion of other products.<br /><br />Without reading too much into it, this is a five-star product that is lightweight with almost no scent, keeps your skin moisturized and hydrated, and prepped for your daily skin care routine.",B084WP4XS8,1624307934053,5.0
AGXMWJK3YL4SV5FJ27JEJZPZHRBA,Good Face Mask for Moisturization,"The order of the face masks come packaged in a box. There are 24 face masks individually packaged. The mask comes with a clear plastic layer underneath that's folded up with the face mask. This allows for the face mask to be easily removed andn opened, because other products just have the face mask folded up by itself and it's always a struggle to unfold them.<br /><br />The face mask is a perfect fit for my face. There are plenty of face masks out there that are oversized or does not have the slits in the right place to fit the face form, but I could tell the fit would be perfect the moment I put them on.<br /><br />The face masks are soaked in hyaluronic acid and there was plenty left in the package after the face mask was removed, for me to squeeze additional gel onto my face. I left the face mask on for about 15 minutes. The area around my nose and cheeks still had plenty of moisture on it but the edges near the chin were dried up. The face mask seems to harden in the areas that are dried up.<br /><br />After the application, my skin did not absorb all the serum and it was still wet. I gently tapped around the area to get it evenly spread and dissolve. The skin felt moisturized. It wasn't sticky nor did it dry up my face. I am satisfied with the result and the product.",B08XZDXTG2,1620761176566,5.0

They are silicone tubes with white plastic caps. It comes with black key chain holder so it’s portable. Each tube holds 60 ML. I put high alcohol content hand sanitizer so it’s more liquid than gel. Unfortunately I have to be extra careful for the liquid to not spill out when using. Otherwise the tubes should be able to contain the get and you’d just squeeze the tube.

I clip it to the shoulder strap (on my chest) of my backpack so my hand sanitizer is always within reach. However, this type of container isn't well suited for squeezing out gels in small amounts. The bottle is so soft that you have to really be careful with how you squeeze it. It easily splurts out blobs that are too much for just hand sanitizer.

The length of the extension is the same as what is said on the site, but its width is a little less and not as wide as shown in the image. The weight of this extension is not low, but it is not so high that it can not be tolerated. Due to the fact that the hair is braided, it is expected to weigh a little more.

For being a matte and not a gloss I’m very surprised that it is as moisturizing as it is. It goes on smooth, very similar to a mousse lip tint I have. With this product I don’t have add chap stick or lip gloss over it because it started to chap and dry out my lips which can be a problem that I have with some other matte lipsticks.

From the foaming hand soap I have the coconut and vanilla, and the lavender and aloe. I thought the lavender and aloe sheets would smell the same as the foaming soap but it does not. Far from it. The sheets smell far too musky, strong, and more like men’s cologne on my hands. Not a fan of that one, but glad the smell doesn’t last long after the hand washing. The bergamot and Ylang ylang, and the jasmine and patchouli both smell nice but it is mild. I would say the bergamot and ylang ylang is a neutral smell, while the jasmine and patchouli are more flowery and a bit more feminine. Like I said, both are mild and after drying off my hands I can barely smell them already. One little pack fits into all my regular little inside purse pockets.

I may only use this on no makeup days.  It is very travel friendly and comes with a nice storage pouch and an extra roller ball.  Very easy to just toss and keep in ones bag.

AFGGRGHGHSFKMZASFBYFRHBBEOPA,Nice sunscreen.🕶,Nice lightweight sunscreen.  This is perfect for wearing under makeup and does not feel thick or oily.  It does leave behind a slightly dewy appearance and is not matte.  No white cast as seen with thicker formulas.  This feels very moisturizing without feeling heavy.  Blends very well into the skin and has a very mild scent.  Bottle is easy to use and to dispense product.  Great sunscreen,B08NJ5BTWG,1618627666551,5.0

I did take a star away because it's battery operated...which i thought having an electric plug would makee it more convenient and worth it to me, less expensive in the long run.

I have one that I do epson salt soaks in and my daughter kept asking if ai could buy her one. This seemed perfect because of the fun colors,  the bubbles, the music and all the extras. It comes with the little spa sandals, toe dividers, nail polish, press on nails, a nail file, and the machine itself of course,  the machine has two buttons one for bubbles and one for music.

The razor gives a super close shave and makes my skin feel soft and smooth. The only thing that makes me nervous is the handle. It becomes slippery in the shower so I can't get a good grip. It worries me that I will cut myself when I am shaving. I searched if the company sells refill blades for this but they don't have them.

AGTGHYRTZXKX4AIL42A3FKWR7SOQ,"Painless and easy to use, but the device gets super hot","I have been using this hair removal device for 2 months now. I used it once every 2 weeks so I've used it 5 times so far. Now, the sessions will be only once a month until all the unwated hair is removed. The manufacturer recommends using it once every 2 weeks for the first 5 sessions and then once a month after that, so using it multiple times a week won't change the outcome. The areas I use this device are my legs, under arms, bikini area and upper lip. The only difference I've noticed so far is the upper lip hair. It is growing significantly less, like almost 90% is gone. The rest of the body hair still grows the same amount, but the hair started to grow softer. I assume the hair is finally becoming weaker. I am half Greek and half Italian, I have olive skin color with dark hair, so it might take over a year for me to see some results. Overall, the device is very easy to use and it is painless, but it gets super hot to the touch after about 5-10 minutes of continues usage. I use the device on my legs first and then take a break until it cools down, and then I continue using it on other parts of the body and stop to cool it down again. I have to admit it is frustrating to stop the session to cool down the device. I don't know if other hair removal devices get this hot. This is my first time using something like this so I can't compare.",B08VJ7CZW3,1632013921516,3.0

BOO!<br /><br />The polish seems to last a decent amount of time.  The matte finish looks a little weird - sort of like a crayon exploded on her fingers.

AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Great travel set,"I forgot to bring a moisturizer on my trip so I requested this.  I like the moisturizer. I find it a little heavy as I put it on but it actually absorbs very well.  The eye cream burned a bit and my skin actually felt drier - perhaps it is tightening the skin rather than providing moisturizer?  Everything but the mask has minimal to no scent.

Said she could not wash it out, it made her hair blue and made her face greasy.  I thought it was tween drama ..... then I tried it.  Yuck.  While it smells GREAT without being perfumey  but it was like conditioning my hair with glue.  It made it super sticky and tangled.

AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Gentle on skin not so much on hair,This brush is gentle on skin.  It isnt the gentlest on long silky hair.  The plastic feels a bit on the brittle and cheap side.  The self cleaning mechanism works well.  The tines are short and spaced close together and it tends to pull more on the topcoat than the undercoat.  I'd say this brush is better suited to larger dogs with shorter hair like a shepherd rather than dogs like my spaniels.,B08KY7VYDS,1611805020604,4.0

The smell is a little heavy compared to some other brands that I have tried.  The scent does subside over time. I also wish it had a pump top instead of the flip-top, but not a deal breaker. So far she has not had a reaction to it so I will continue using it.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",B096YHL82K,1632593173611,5.0
AEV7Q27IHW3CU2NGA5NMHVHTLIAQ,"Perfect viscosity for face, a little goes a long way","The Terre de Mars oil serum is a nice emulsion made partly of primrose oil and caffeine with the purpose of brightening and hydrating the facial area for several hours. After each morning use of a few drops, my face is hydrated for the rest of the day and the moisture it provides is even more long-lasting in more humid/hot weather. Although not too viscous, it can become sticky if you apply more than necessary, so a small amount is enough to give your skin the desired effects. Also perfect for sensitive skin and it has a very very faint floral smell that is undetectable soon after applying.",B08WCQWP3T,1633474268555,4.0
AEIW7GMVHQ4HBUXTTYEMHEMADUMQ,Nice Moisturizer,"This moisturizer is described as a gel cream and contains aloe vera and hyaluronic acid. The latter is something I always want in face creams because it does a great job on my aging skin. The aloe vera is a nice touch, as well.<br /><br />I'm usually the one complaining about fragrances, but this time, I'm happy. The  gel-cream has a light (quickly dissipating) scent that's herby, almost minty. Unlike many fragrances, it doesn't bother my sinuses, plus I enjoy the odor.<br /><br />This product goes on clear and soaks in fast. I mainly use it on a dry spot on my face that flakes if I skip hyaluronic for more than a day or two. There's no sign of the flaky spot, so I'm very happy with this reasonably-priced cream.",B08HVRP54L,1656279980150,5.0
AEIW7GMVHQ4HBUXTTYEMHEMADUMQ,Mmmm -- It's Fabulous!,"I'm fragrance-sensitive and any man-made scent will instantly curl my nose and tweak my sinuses and put me in a foul mood as I scrub my skin with dish soap to get rid of the odor.  Sasy n Savy's Citrus Souffle Body Cream makes my nose and sinuses very, very happy. It's naturally and deliciously scented and my skin just eats it up.<br /><br />This cream is light and soaks in very quickly. It moisturizes very well and gets rid of itchiness caused by dry skin.  Made with all-natural ingredients including those delicious essential citrus oils, hibiscus, and oils of macadamia and avocado, there's nothing bad in the ingredient list, and it's cruelty-free. It quenches my skin and the pleasant scent lingers faintly for quite a while. I keep a tube on my desk and use it several times a day. Its scent is uplifting and its moisturizing properties are fabulous.",B009GPP546,1652118484590,5.0

(With these, fried chicken at a picnic wouldn't be too messy.) Yesterday, after a couple hours of gardening in the hot sun, I used one sturdy wipe (they're about 8""X5"") on my face, neck, chest, arms, and hands, as a very refreshing clean-up.<br /><br />These are nothing but essential oil and water, no chemicals, so your skin won't be dried out or irritated.

AEXO6YBJHQZFPLVRQJI6VX7IJDNA,The perfect bit of shine to add to your lips,"I love this trio of lipgloss. The flavors are very popular fragrances of strawberry, grape, and bubblegum. The strawberry and the grape do appear to be slightly tinted, but you will not notice any real color added to your lips from them. You can use them alone and enjoy just a nice clear gloss over your natural color lips, or you can put it over top of your color and no worry of changing the color of your favorite lipstick. It will add a very nice bit of shine and a little bit of a sparkle to whatever color you decide to slide it over.  I do not notice a lot of flavor to these glosses, but the color is very pretty. I feel that the box is a nice addition if you plan on giving these as a gift. I think this would make a wonderful gift for a young girl or even an older lady. I can’t imagine anybody that wouldn’t enjoy receiving this trio of lip glosses. I felt the price was extremely fair and that the quality of this item was very good.",B09SH1FD9S,1650153328582,5.0
AEXO6YBJHQZFPLVRQJI6VX7IJDNA,Nice feel and Great Color,I really love this color and the feel of this lipstick.  I was impressed too with how pretty the packaging was.  There's nothing nicer than when you take your lipstick out of your purse and everyone sees how pretty the tube is - but I digress.  This lipstick is a great nude color and goes well with just about anything I wear - be it red or pink.  You must always have a good versatile lipstick color in your purse at all times.  Your clothes change but you always take the same purse when you're out and about.  Your lipstick in that purse should go with everything you're wearing.  The feel of this lipstick is also very nice which is a huge plus.  I think the price is fair for such a nice quality lipstick.,B09HMXY36F,1636553153325,5.0

With a consistency similar to a new bottle of luxury brand traditional polish they are a dream to apply. You get total coverage in two coats and they cure beautifully.<br /><br />The colors are ridiculously bright and I have no idea what I’m going to use them for, but right now it just makes me smile to look at my swatches and that’s good enough for me!",B08W8LKLHB,1624248392072,5.0

Old or young, this mask is for you!<br /><br />It’s a nice, thin sheet and every package has more than enough serum in it. After placing the face mask (which fits me well) I use the extra serum on my neck, décolleté, and hands. I usually read or watch something on my tablet while I’m wearing it which means I have my glasses on. I am so pleased that they sit well on my nose and don’t interfere with the action of the mask in any way. It has never irritated my sensitive skin, and has proven soothing when my skin is having a reaction to something else.<br /><br />These are also remarkably affordable (when I ordered them) for what you get which means I can use them regularly rather than save them for emergencies and special occasions!<br /><br />10/10 Would recommend!",B08XZDXTG2,1621715663478,5.0
AEHGY7TZA4IMOXXBGPTZC7UPM6UQ,Not moisturizing.,"[[VIDEOID:4eaf048eb55433860172118977ad0ff1]] I’ve used the entire box, exactly as directed and cannot recommend this product.<br /><br />The only things I liked about this product is that it’s unscented and the packaging is kind of fun, but that is absolutely outweighed by the possibility cutting yourself.<br /><br />It does not do what it says. It doesn’t provide “intensive plumping” or”improve skin elasticity” which are just ridiculous claims, particularly when you consider this used for one week and the first two ingredients are water and glycerine. I have pure glycerine and  after mixing it with water in various percentages, I’d be comfortable betting that this product is at least 70% water.<br /><br />I was able to cleanly snap all seven ampoules using the plastic topper provided. Even though my snaps were clean the edges of both pieces are sharp and you shouldn’t touch them. It took me several tries to figure out how to get all the serum out of the ampoules. For three days I was tapping the opening on my palm which didn’t feel great, but I just couldn’t get it to pour out cleanly.<br /><br />Although it is almost as liquid as water, if you get the opening of the ampoules covered with the liquid it won’t come out because of surface tension. If this happens just turn the bottle open side up and blow on the liquid until the opening is clear and you’re good to go.<br /><br />If you can tilt the bottle just right you can get the serum to pour out. It’s tricky, but spend the time doing it that way and you’ll save yourself a lot of frustration. You see me getting it right in the video, but even then I had to blow the ampoule open once.<br /><br />There is also the cost. $50.00 for one week of use. That’s about $200 a month and $1250 a year although it does specify that you should use this daily for six weeks, maximum. Why? Is that concerning to anyone else? Anyway, even if you have money to burn you would do well spending it on a procedure from a dermatologist or a flight to Dubai for vacation.

The ergonomics are fantastic, it's a hefty metal body with nice curves. The blade nestles in the top groove with metal surrounding it...This makes for a difficult close shave from my bald head curves, I like to press down harder and get a close shave but the surrounding metal prevents that from happening. However, on my neck and cheeks, it does well, particularly with a dry shave.<br /><br />The foam is nice but nothing special. Doesn't slick up great but has a nice scent. The holder is okay...Sturdy but holds the blade loosely. Also, as of now, I don't see where I can get replacement blades.",B0932Z1NM1,1630995941705,3.0

Has a designer fragrance to it, a little body spray but a bit more classy.<br /><br />Performance is okay. The balm is very fluffy ad soft like coconut butter. It doesn't tame as much as I like but softens and gives a nice glow.<br /><br />Overall I want to hate on this but just can't...

The fragrance is very mild but mostly lavender.<br /><br />Okay - for infants - not so much. However, if you have a toddler and you know they want to do EXACTLY everything they SEE you do! So, I ordered this for my little one to have her own ""perfume"" to use! It is always used in a controlled fashion, and it is not used often. But when she sees mommy using her perfume, its right there so my little miss can use hers! She thinks it is wonderful. The fragrance is light, but it does seem a might bit expensive. 4 Stars.

I typically struggle to get a nice thin line and with this liner, it goes on pretty easy. 4 Stars. Hope you find this review and pictures helpful. It stayed on all day without smudging.

The candle is also a nice touch and smelled amazing! This is probably silly, but my favorite item in the box was actually the bottle opener that is shaped like a key. It is so unique and functional, and something that will last a long time. I was not so impressed with the wine stopper. It looks like metal but is made of plastic. I also don't really like messages on my cups, so would have preferred that to be plain or with a graphic/picture design. The cup itself is good and has a nice sliding lid that fits quite snuggly.

AHTOPAM4UMS6AZRFWMBBXWNYYEVQ,Good Razor But Seller Does Not Offer Separate Replacement Heads,"This razor is different from any of the ones I have used before. I love the magnetic head that pops right into place. The handle is fairly comfortable to hold and the frame of the razor head has a moisturizing coating that gets activated with water and helps lubricate skin for easy gliding. The razor blades are sharp and help achieve a clean shave. This is supposedly good for about 2 months of use, after which the replacement head that comes with the razor can be changed. I also love the ceramic base that the razor comes with and can be stored in.<br />Now for the critical part. Although the handle is comfortable, the slick coating may make it a little slippery if using in the shower. The magnetic razor heads, although a unique and interesting feature, are impossible to find the replacement for. Even the seller's page only lists the razor itself, but not the replacement heads. This means that after the 2 heads that the razor comes with have been used up, you would have to purchase a new razor.",B095C1WF44,1632837994917,3.0

I had a hard time getting the pump opened initially. I even looked for instructions on the bottle on how to open the pump. It was almost child proof, but I finally got it.  Once opened, the pump worked well and dispensed the product with no issues. The 2-pack is a great value, with each bottle containing 24.5 oz.

AEZUL3R34WWAORYARPTJG2X6KC5Q_1,"It’s ok, could be better","I found this Terre De Mars facial oil to be just a mediocre face oil. I use Facebook oils regularly, and this one just doesn’t seam to want to soak into my skin like most do. Even if I use a very small amount it just sits on top of my skin. That being said it doesn’t feel super greasy or oily on my face which is nice.<br /><br />I have combination skin and I found if I put this on my T-zone it seamed to make my face produce more oil during the day than normal. Where as on my drier areas it seamed to work much better. Overall I think if you have dry skin then you may like this particular oil. But more oily skin types may not.",B08WCQWP3T,1637130990754,3.0
AEZUL3R34WWAORYARPTJG2X6KC5Q_1,"Looks lux, but that’s about all it has going for it","I always wondered why no companies ever made 6 bladed razors, but after using this SUPRENT I think I have an idea…<br /><br />This razor looks amazingly sleek and stylish. From the blades and the curve of the handle, to the stylish holder. It oozes style and luxury. That is until you actually want to use it…<br /><br />Just as they claim the handle is alloy and has a good bit of weight to it. But what they don’t tell you is that with wet, sweaty, or shaving foam covered hands this feels like a bar of soap in the shower or one of those slippery snake toys we used to have when I was growing up. The razor head is fixed in what they call an “optimum angle”, except it’s really not. Imagine trying to keep your grip on one of those slippery snakes, while trying to maneuver your hand at all kinds of odd angles to get that “optimum angle”, while 6 nice and sharp blades are around your jugular….<br /><br />Unfortunately this looks great, but functionally it doesn’t perform. And to be honest that’s a shame since I have used a few different clipper sets from SUPRENT that were amazing all around. This just unfortunately isn’t one of them.",B0932Z1NM1,1632353473062,1.0
AEZUL3R34WWAORYARPTJG2X6KC5Q_1,Works better than ones that cones nearly 2x the price,"I absolutely love these types of nano facial misters and have purchased quite a few over the last 6 months or so both higher and lower end. This TIANG one is about mid level price wise, but I actually thing this works better in a lot of aspects than my more expensive one that costs about 2x the price!<br /><br />My favorite facial mister prior to this was the Flight Mode Cloud Mister which is usually between $40-$50 depending on if it’s on sale or not at that time. And personally I think this TIANG one works even better!<br /><br />First you can actually put an watery essence in this TIANG one, unlike the Flight mode one that doesn’t allow it. This TIANG one also has a better spray than my flight mode one. The flight mode one is insanely fine, honestly it’s actually to fine but it was still my favorite up until now. This TIANG one is slightly stronger of a spray which is enough to really mist your face without feeling like you dumping skincare or water on your skin. This TIANG one also holds a charge longer and I can easily get a day or two out of it even if I am using it frequently throughout the day.<br /><br />The only real negative is the size of this TIANG one bits much larger than my old one and most of the others I have tried.

It’s not relaxing at all and it’s way to strong for a pillow spray.<br /><br />Generally I love hibiscus scents, but there is just something really off about this one, it’s almost perfume like. Plus the sprayer nozzle on this is terrible. It shouts out huge droplets that splatter everywhere and leak down the container and onto my hand every time. They put two different caps on this, but then the sprayer is terrible… why? Overall I was just really unimpressed by this.

I did not use conditioner.<br />My hair felt soft while on my hair and after rinsing, Once I was air drying my hair, my hair was not as soft.<br />It was manageable but it had some elasticity which i did not like.<br />Once fully dried my hair felt like it had a film over it.<br />it did help with fly aways and frizzyness.<br />I had to use a significant amount because of my long hair, so I do not expect this to last long/ many uses, thus I consider the price a bit high.<br />I will continue to use it a couple of times and if there is a positive change, I will update.<br />Yet as of now, after this bottle/tube, this will not be a hair product I will continue to use.",B083PXJBVY,1631810149258,3.0

A pea-size amount covers most of my face. I don't like thick layers of make-up, since it clogs my pores up, so I usually just wear one coat and one coat of this foundation provides great coverage.<br />I have been wearing this foundation for about 2 weeks (off & on) and it does not cause break-outs.<br />I hope they continue selling this because I have found my foundation.<br />Love the bag and the primer, the sponges not so much.",B08SBV6Z57,1626763076907,5.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,2 of 3 have micro glitter (mica). Sticky but not too bad. Moisturizing,"These come in a nice little box. They are vegan and cruelty free. They are made in the USA. I included the ingredients at the end of my review.<br /><br />You get 3 glosses - a peachy pink toned one that has a strawberry scent/flavor, a more reddish toned one that has a grape scent/flavor, and a clear one that has a bubble gum scent/flavor. As for the scents, I can notice them when applying, not so much after the fact. I don’t really notice a taste really with any of them, but the ingredients do list “flavor” not fragrance/parfum, so it made me think they’d have more taste to them. Not a big deal to me though.<br /><br />While 2 of them are tinted in color, the color doesn’t really translate onto the lips. They just look clear on the lips. They don’t change any color of lip liner, lipstick, matte lip, etc. that I put them over top of. So, I liked that.<br /><br />The formula is nice. It feels nice and moisturizing on the lips, which I expected given they have nice moisturizing ingredients like Shea butter, coconut oil, and squalane. They do feel SLIGHTLY sticky on the lips. I hate sticky glosses, but these aren’t overly sticky. They don’t feel thick or heavy on the lips. They feel nice and thin. They are glosses so they do need re-applied often throughout the day. But, I’m used to that with glosses so it’s not a big deal to me.<br /><br />The strawberry and grape both have micro glitter in them (mica). I didn’t know that when I got these. None of the product photos showed they had glitter and the description didn’t say it either. I’m not a fan of micro glitter in my lip glosses. I feel once the gloss wears off, it usually leaves behind glitter particles on my lips. Also, they can sometimes feel gritty. So, I was surprised when I saw 2 of the 3 had glitter. Luckily, these didn’t feel gritty. I do notice that there are some glitter particles on my lips after they wear off, but it’s not too bad. The glitter particles are really small, so it’s not really noticeable. So, I don’t mind that.<br /><br />Overall, these are nice glosses with a nice formula. They might seem pricey when seeing the $30 price tag, but you’re getting 3 tubes of glosses, so that’s only $10 a piece, which isn’t bad. Of course, it isn’t great. You can get a tube of gloss that looks great and works just as well from the drugstore for slightly less. But, the ingredients might make it worth it to spend the little more. I give them 4 stars.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Bubblegum Lip Glossy:<br />Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Isododecane, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Flavor, Sorbitan Oleate, Squalane, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate).<br /><br />*Organic/Biologique.<br /><br />Grape Lip Glossy:<br />Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Isododecane, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Flavor, Sorbitan Oleate, Squalane, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Tocopherol, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Iron Oxides (CI 77492), Red 33 (CI#17200), CI 15850 (Red 7), Iron Oxides (CI 77499).<br /><br />*Organic/Biologique.<br /><br />Strawberry Lip Glossy:<br />Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Isododecane, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Flavor, Sorbitan Oleate, Squalane, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Tocopherol, Titanium Dioxide, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mica, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Iron Oxides (CI 77492), Red 27 Lake (CI 45410), Silica, Tin Oxide.<br /><br />*Organic/Biologique",B09SH1FD9S,1656203229874,4.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"Works really well, but even getting 2 in 1, it’s pricier than my go-to drugstore liquid liners","This comes in an outer product box. It is made in Korea. The product page says it is cruelty free and vegan, but I didn’t see any kind of certified logo saying it was on the product box. It is free of parabens, sulfates, gluten, and “other harsh chemicals.”<br /><br />This is a dual ended liquid liner. One end has a felt tip and one end has a brush tip. The caps are labeled, which is great! I don’t have to pull off the tops every time to figure out which end is which! Of course, since the labels are on the CAPS, you have to make sure not to mix them up. I don’t see myself having an issue with that since I don’t ever see a reason I’d take off both ends at the same time. But, if you do, you definitely want to make sure to put the correct cap on the correct side so you don’t mix them up. It probably would have been better for them to put the label on the center part rather than the caps, but it’s fine as long as you don’t take both ends off at the same time or just make sure to put the right caps back on.<br /><br />Both ends work really well. They glide on easily without skipping or bleeding. They are a pigmented black, not thin or watery black. They dry down quickly and stay in place throughout the day without smudging or coming off. I have really small, really hooded eyes, so having a dual ended eyeliner pen is great! I have the brush tip to get the thin tightline I want on my upper lash line, then I have the thicker felt tip to do my little wing when I want to. Both work great.<br /><br />When I first saw it was priced at $28.50, I thought that was pretty darn pricey for an eyeliner. But, it is dual ended, so you’re getting 2 eyeliners in 1 pen. Looking at it that way, it’s $14.25 a pen. I usually spend somewhere around $8-10 on my usual ones at the drugstore, so $14.25 isn’t the cheapest, but it isn’t too bad either. Personally, I love it being dual ended, but not enough to spend more than I spend on my usual liquid liners. My usual one at the drugstore ones are $10 (NYX Epic Wear Liquid Liner) and $8 (Maybelline Curvitude Angled Liquid Liner) and I never have any issues with them. So, I don’t see myself spending $28.50, even if I’m getting 2 for 1 because that’s still $14.25 each, which is more than I usually spend on my liquid liners. If price isn’t an issue for you, this is a really good liquid liner. Both ends work great and it’s a nice formula. I give it 4 stars.",B09LWV3HH2,1646557460248,4.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"Great razor, but no way to buy just replacement heads (at least not when I’m writing this)","First the good…<br />I love the razor! It’s cute and comfortable to hold. The razor has 5 blades that are stainless steel. It says they’re made of high quality steel in the USA. The razor head is magnetic so it just clicks right on, I was a little worried with it being magnetic that it might slide or move during use, but the magnets are strong and I wouldn’t even know they were attached magnetically has I not done it myself 😂 It has a metal handle that’s comfortable to hold. There’s a nice ceramic base for it to sit in when you’re not using it. The razor head moves nicely to conform to your body as you shave. It says it goes down 15 degrees and up 65 degrees (it says degrees Celsius in the image but that’s only for temp, not angles so not sure why they added the C? 😂). It has aloe on top AND bottom for extra protection and slip, which is nice. It said it came with 2 replacement razors, which I thought meant it came with the main one and then 2 additional ones, making 3, but it only comes with 2.<br /><br />Now for the bad…<br />They recommend to replace the blades every 2 months. But how?! There’s no replacement heads here on Amazon. Why sell something on here that requires replacement heads but not sell the replacement heads on here? Hopefully they will add them before I need them because I love the razor. The razor is currently $11.99. For that you get the razor handle part, ceramic stand, and 2 razor heads. So, if I replace the razor head every 2 months like they recommend, I’ll get 4 months of use out of this. Do I want to spend $11.99 every 4 months just to get replacement heads? That is $5.99 per replacement head if that’s all I’m buying it for. Then I also get a ceramic base every time that I won’t need since I’ll already have one and another razor handle, which I guess isn’t a big deal to replace over time. I can get 4 Venus Gillette replacement heads here on Amazon for $10.99. It’s basically the same thing but I can actually buy a replacement head for it.<br /><br />So, I’m not sure about this. I love the razor, but it isn’t anything crazy special. The Venus Gillette ones I usually use have aloe on them and 5 blades that work well. I don’t get the nice ceramic base for it to sit in, but that’s not a huge deal to me. I can at least replace the heads easily with it. So, it’s up to you if you don’t mind spending the $11.99 to get replacement heads for this and having to get the handle and base every time too. It’s a really nice razor that works well and is comfortable to hold, and it has a nice base to sit in. The only downside is the replacement heads. Like I said, hopefully they’ll add the replacement heads onto Amazon soon. Right now, I’d say it’s a great razor and if you don’t mind that you can’t buy replacement heads for it, I’d recommend it. If you do mind that you can’t get replacement heads for it, I’d still say it’s a great razor so maybe by the time you’re reading this they have added the replacement heads onto Amazon, so you can check and see! If they have, I’d recommend it. If not, I’d say skip them if it’s an issue not being able to buy just the replacement heads.",B095C1WF44,1636308102467,4.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Nice glowy finish with good coverage. Contains chemical sunscreen ingredients.,"This comes in an outer product box. It is made in Korea. The info on the box is not in English. I assume it’s Korean since that’s where it’s made. I hate when companies sell a product in the US, but then don’t put the product info in English. They did include the ingredients on the product page, I included them at the end of the review. This is NOT reef safe since it contains chemical sunscreen ingredients like octinoxate and octocrylene. I didn’t realize this had chemical sunscreen ingredients in it like octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene. I prefer physical sunscreens. But, it was my own fault for not looking closer at the ingredient list before getting this.<br /><br />This does contain silicones, alcohol, and parfum too.<br /><br />It has some good ingredients too like niacinamide, glycerin, jojoba seed oil, adenosine, sunflower seed oil, squalane, centella asiatica leaf extract, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), honey extract, and madecassoside.<br /><br />I love cushion foundations. I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side, with some extremely dry areas. Cushion foundations usually give me great coverage but look natural and healthy on my skin. This one claimed to “plump your skin” with “advanced luminous lasting cushion.” It claimed to be “fitting and superstay” that it had “advanced formula Fixative Polymer technology, which forming a moisture film on your skin, keep your skin hydrated, moistured and leaving your skin with the most luminous look. Simultaneously, this film helps to keep the foundation layer thin yet stay fit all day long.” I didn’t like the idea of a film on my skin, but liked the idea of it hydrating my skin and giving it a luminous look, but lasting all day.<br /><br />This comes in a black plastic compact. It has magnetic closure. When you open the top there is a mirror in the lid and a little cushion applicator. When you take off the cushion applicator you’ll see the little plastic shelf that covers the cushion foundation. There’s a little tab to pull on to open it. Once you open it, there is a protective cover over the cushion that you remove. Make sure to always push down the shelf part over top of the cushion completely so that the cushion doesn’t dry out.<br /><br />This comes in 2 shades - “21 Light Beige,” which is described as “bright and glamorous light beige,” and “23 Natural Beige,” which is described as “natural and lively natural beige.” I have very fair skin so I can usually go for the lightest shade and can make it work for me. But, I wasn’t quite sure which would work best for me so I got both.<br /><br />I took a photo of swatches I did. I did a photo showing a swatch of shade “23 Natural Beige,” “21 Light Beige,” and a comparison swatch of Maybelline Fit Me Matte+Poreless in 110 Porcelain. I always like to use the Maybelline Fit Me since I know a lot of people have tried it and hopefully know their shade in it so they can hopefully get an idea of if the shade will work for them when compared to the Maybelline shade.<br /><br />“21 Light Beige” is lighter. Usually the lower number is the lighter one, but sometimes that’s not always the case because of undertone or just weird labeling. In my opinion, the swatches in the product photos are much lighter than they appear in person. I’d say that they are definitely at least a shade darker in person than they appear in the product photo. They both have yellow undertones.<br /><br />They provide good, natural coverage and gives a glowy finish. It doesn’t transfer once it’s dries down, which is nice. I don’t even need to set it with powder. Since I have normal to dry skin, I prefer not to use powder where I don’t have to. But, with glowy foundations it’s usually needed. So, I like that I don’t need to with this! It doesn’t give full coverage, but can be built up to medium. If you use a the included sponge or a beauty sponge for application you can get light coverage with 1 layer, medium with 2 layers. If you use a brush for application you can get medium coverage with 1 layer, but I find it looks to heavy if you try to apply a second layer using a sponge. My preferred method is using a brush to apply a thin layer, and then going over it with a sponge to kind of make sure it’s all blended in nicely. Then, if any areas need additional coverage, I’ll use the sponge to add some additional product where I need it.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a really nice cushion foundation.

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Stunning!,"This comes packaged nicely. It comes in an outer product box. It has styrofoam protecting it well. It even had a little styrofoam kind of eye mask protecting the eyes! Mine did have a little gouge on the collarbone, but it was only little so not a big deal to me.<br /><br />It’s GORGEOUS! She has makeup and beautiful eyes with lashes! There’s a kind of wig cap on top of the head that seems to be glued on.<br /><br />It doesn’t state the size of the head or how tall the mannequin is. The head seems to fit standard wigs (22-22.5”). There is a photo that shows a measuring tape around the head. Why they could show that but not actually state the measurement is beyond me. But, it looks like it’s about 54 and 1/4 cm. 54 cm is 21 inches, which seems about right. When I put a 22” wig on this, it fits snugly. I measured the height and it’s about 16.5” tall.<br /><br />The bottom has a kind of felt on it so it moves easily.<br /><br />She even has pierced ears if you want to put earrings in.<br /><br />Overall, this is a gorgeous, well made mannequin head! You can use it for wigs and jewelry.",B0998BD871,1633614769725,5.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Fills in fine lines and pores giving a smooth base for foundation,"This is interesting! I’ve never seen a primer that comes with a brush built in like this! You push the bottom and 3 dots come out onto the brush. How I apply my primer usually depends on the primer I use. There’s some I use that I apply with my fingers to help melt the product into my skin and really press it into my skin. There’s some I apply with a brush to really spread it out. A while ago I watched a video from a well known makeup artist. He said that if you want to hide your pores, you can use a brush and basically press the product INTO the pores. Yes, your occluding the pore by using the bristles on the brush to put product INTO the pores, rather than just going over the pores, but if you wash your face well at the end of the day it shouldn’t be an issue. He said when you take the brush, you use the bristles to push the product into the pores, which fills them, and leads to an even base. If you use a product that just kind of layers over the pores, they aren’t filled, they just have a layer over them. A lot of times just having a layer over them works. It creates a smooth layer to put your base on. But, throughout the day the layer kind of breaks down and you end up with your pores showing. If you had actually put product into the pores, then they would continue to be filled and leave you looking smooth all day. So, ever since then I try to use a brush when applying product where I want my pores filled. So, this coming with a built in brush was perfect!<br /><br />The brush is soft. It isn’t rough or scratchy. With 1 push giving 3 dots of product onto the brush I have enough product for everywhere I want to use it.<br /><br />It makes my skin nice and smooth, so I have a smooth base to apply my foundation on.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great primer! It fills in fine lines and pores. The built in brush really helps with that. And foundation goes over it great!",B0977LVHF8,1632662411674,5.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Powder gives light wash of color. Good for someone who doesn’t need too much.,"A little while back I got an eyebrow stamp kit like this and loved it! The only thing I wished was that the eyebrow stamp was a little thinner. When I saw this kit and saw the stamp looked a lot thinner than the one I had, I had to try it!<br /><br />This comes with the brow stamp, 24 brow stencils, and 4 spoolie brushes.<br /><br />Theres a whopping 24 eyebrow stencils included in this kit! That’s crazy! So, I’m sure most everyone can find a shape that they like for their brows among these stencils. Unlike most kits that have brow stencils like these, these have adhesive backing that sticks to you. Most kits I’ve gotten like these the stencils are plastic, so reusable. I like that they stick because you don’t have to worry about holding them perfectly in place while also trying to use the stamp to fill in your brows and worry about it moving some. But, I don’t like that they aren’t really reusable like this since once you pull off the backing and stick them on, they won’t stick anymore.<br /><br />The first time I tried a brow powder stamping kit I wasn’t expecting much. I kind of expected this to make ugly, thick, blocky looking eyebrows. But, this actually works great! The product in the stamp is powder, so it creates a nice, light color, and you can dab more to build it up if you want. Once you use the spoolie, it looks pretty natural. You can also add pencil to if you wanted.<br /><br />I don’t have thick brows, but I don’t have extremely sparse brows. My brows are thinner, where you can see skin poking through, but there’s basically an even amount of hair all the way across. I used to just leave my brows be, but when I do a full face of makeup I do feel like my brows need a little something. So, I started doing my brows. I usually do a little tinted brow gel. It usually gives enough tint to make them look a little fuller and complete, but not so much where they look too thick. I feel like since I’m just starting to do my brows, whenever I have them filled completely I think they look too thick and weird 😂 So, I like a middle area. So, using this stamp works well for me. If I’m doing full glam, I like to apply it to get a kind of light wash of color. Then, I’ll kind of go over the tail a little with some more powder to darken it a little more. Then, I’ll take a brow pencil and do a few kind of hair like strokes in the front. Sometimes I’ll go in and do some brow gel if I feel they need more defined. This fills them out nicely, makes them look complete, but doesn’t make them look too dark or full. If I am doing a more natural look, I’ll just use the brow powder in the stamp. I do feel that there isn’t a ton of product that comes out and I’m not sure how much product is in the stamp. I don’t mind that not a lot comes out, I actually prefer it. But, if you wanted more product, it might be kind of annoying for you.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice little set! It is a nice way to try different brow shapes to see what you like for yourself. The product works well. The brow powder looks natural and lasts nicely in the brows. I would definitely recommend this for someone who isn’t sure about their brow shape - what they like best on their face, what shape works best, how to fill in brows, etc. This set will help with those things! If you’re someone that just likes a little wash of color and fuller, more filled out brows, this would help with that. If you’re someone who likes a lot of color in the brows, you might not like this since it just gives a wash of color. So, I would recommend it but only if you’re someone who wants to try out different brow shapes to get an idea of what works for you or if you’re someone who likes a light wash of color throughout their brows.",B0994HWXVV,1631483394640,4.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Exactly what I needed to make picking up rhinestones/gems/sequins/etc. easy!,"These are great! They feel nice to hold. Not flimsy. They’re comfortable in the hand. Plus, they have a cute look to them!<br /><br />They are dual ended. You have the wax tip that picks up rhinestones/gems or any other nail art like sequins or charms. Then there is a stainless steel tip that you use to press down the rhinestone/gem/etc. to keep them in place. You can also pick up a little rhinestone glue with the stainless steel tip and use it to apply a small dot of glue to where you want it on the nail. It’s so helpful!<br /><br />I needed something to help me pick up rhinestones, gems, sequins, charms, etc. When I tried to use one of those pencils to pick up rhinestones, it worked but not every time, so I’d have to fuss around with it. Using tweezers worked, but it’s hard to not have the rhinestones/gems slip through them and sequins are so thin it’s hard to pick up just one. I tried using a little brush to pick up sequins and things like that, which worked, but sometimes I’d only get 1 or 2, sometimes I’d get a ton that were overlapping. So nothing seemed to work right and be totally easy to use. Until these! I really have no complaints!<br /><br />Overall, I definitely recommend these if you do a lot of nail rhinestones/gems or art using sequins/charms/etc. It’s totally worth it to help with the ease of application and save you time and frustration trying to use something else. If you don’t do a lot of nail art using stuff like rhinestones/gems/sequins/charms/etc., then it might be fine just using something you probably already have like tweezers or a brush. But, if you were going to buy one of those pencils that pick up rhinestones/gems, I say skip that and go for these! They work so much better and you get 2 of them!",B093H28PD4,1631278746134,5.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"Thought this was amazing, but now only like it..read UPDATE at bottom of review","I’d been using the Sol De Janeiro Bum Bum Body Scrub. I looooove that scrub. It smells AMAZING and the smell stays with you. You know how most body scrubs smell nice but as soon as you’re done using it, you can’t really smell it on you? Well, the Bum Bum Body Scrub isn’t like that! You can smell it on you after, heck, my whole apartment smells like coconut after using it! BUUUUT it’s $42 and it’s a sugar scrub so it goes FAST. I also hate the container it comes in. It’s cute, but it’s a pain to open in the shower, get your hand in there and get some scrub out, and it dissolves pretty quick as water hits it since it’s a sugar scrub. So, I wanted a sugar scrub that was more affordable, but still smelled great, that wasn’t such a pain to get out in the shower, and that possibly didn’t dissolve so quick when water hit it. THIS SCRUB CHECKS ALL THOSE BOXES!<br /><br />It’s way more affordable than the Bum Bum scrub. It comes in a jar, so you have to screw the top off, similar to the Bum Bum scrub. But, a lot easier. It smells amazing, like vanilla. It isn’t as strong smelling as the Bum Bum scrub, but I still feel like I can smell it on me after my shower. The BEST part....this is a “Sugar Balm Body Scrub.” The balm makes it kind of like a thicker, kind of paste. It is easier to pick up with your hands, spread on your body, and it doesn’t dissolve anywhere close to as quick as most sugar scrubs.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this scrub! I will definitely replace it when I run out, and definitely recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE - The first few times I used this, I don’t know how I didn’t notice. But, when I was using it again, I saw a loose hair from my head on my arm, I went to pick it up and as I did, my nails kind of scraped against my skin. I felt gunk go under my nails. I looked and saw all this gunk under the 2 nails that scraped against my skin! I was like, “WHAT THE HECK?!” So, then I took my nails and scraped against another area I’d used the scrub at and the same thing happened. I remembered people saying this left a film on their skin, which at the time I initially wrote my review I didn’t feel it did. But, now I DEFINITELY say it does. BUT, it can be washed off. After I scraped my skin and found out about the gunk, I took a regular body wash on a wash cloth and went over the areas I’d used the scrub. After that I scraped my nails over the areas again and, thankfully, no gunk. So, you can get the residue off. Now, whether or not you want to go through scrubbing your body with this scrub and then go over it again with soap or body wash, that’s up to you. For me, it’s not a big deal because I like how this is a balm that doesn’t rinse away as quickly as a regular sugar scrub does. I like that I can spread it onto my body and then scrub without worrying about it melting away as soon as it touches my skin. So, I’m okay dealing with having to go over the areas with a body wash after using it. But, I’m definitely going to keep searching to find the perfect body sugar scrub that is affordable and doesn’t melt away quickly like this one, but that doesn’t leave a film I have to wash off after using it. So, I’m dropping my rating down from a 5 to a 3. I thought about only dropping it to a 4 since I still like it and am willing to deal with having to go over and wash again where I used it. But, it is still kind of a pain to have to do, so I decided to drop it to a 3.",B07FPS2VFK,1624403602502,3.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"Not Creamy, Not Pigmented...","This comes in a cute outer product box. Inside, the pencil is wrapped in plastic.<br /><br />The pencil is a standard jumbo kind of pencil and has a clear lid. I show a photo comparing it to a pen to show size.<br /><br />I got the shade “Chalfont - 303,” which is described as a “shimmering shade of Pearl.” For me, this just wasn’t great. For me, I just think it’s definitely not worth $18 (at the time of writing this review).<br /><br />The product info page describes the pencil as having “intense colour.” I did not notice any intensity of color! It says, “Use your makeup highlighter pencil as a creamy, velvety eyeshadow, eyeliner, and highlighter. Apply it to your inner corners and entire eyelid for a pop of intense colour.” This pencil wasn’t creamy or velvety. To me it felt really dry and was even kind of powdery on application. It also says, “It can be used on its own with a beautiful opaque colour payoff, or built up for extra glamour thanks to its vibrant pigment.” It didn’t seem opaque at all. It could be because I got a shimmer Pearl shade. But, when I applied it, you could hardly see it, I had to really layer it, and even then it’s just not very noticeable.<br /><br />I’ve tried other Pippa of London products and they’ve been great. Unfortunately, this pencil wasn’t one of them. This was a no for me. It could have been the color, maybe if I would have gotten a darker color it would have performed as the product page describes. But, that shouldn’t be the case. The pencil should perform as described no matter what color you get. So, I wouldn’t recommend this.",B08JCX3DL7,1612347857978,1.0

Its not a scent that broadcasts itself to a whole room like a teenager cologne.<br /><br />Looks like they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.<br />So trust me, buy one of the oud products they have available, maybe just the $15 bottle.  If you arent keen on it then you just contact the seller.<br />I doubt that will happen though.  As soon as you smell it you will probably go ahead and buy the larger bottle, or maybe by then the cologne will be out.<br />Thats what happened to me.

AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Great formula,"I think you have to know how to use this foundation for it to work. I have a strict skin care routine and since I’ve started to really pay attention to my skin most  foundations I use look great. This is a medium coverage foundation. And you probably would need two coats to cover any dark spots and even out your skin tone. I exfoliate my face three times a week and I feel the foundation sits better on my skin when I do. The formula is light. The primer is supposed to smooth out your skin. So I mainly use it on my T zone where I have larger pores. And I apply a super glowy and dewy primer on the rest of my face. I like to apply some foundation with my finger and spread it around on my face and then I go with one of the sponges. The sponges feel a little dense. Make sure you wet them before blending the foundation. These sponges work better damp. They don’t absorb the foundation too much, which is great. The foundation blends beautifully and gives me enough coverage to cover my imperfections. I do like to set it with powder as well and it usually works great under powder. I’d like to set it because I feel like it lasts all day long then when I don’t. Make sure you hydrate your skin very well before applying this foundation.

AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Really great,"I live down South, in South Florida, and I'm no stranger to a nice coconut scent. This body wash smells so nice. The other thing about that, is that the scent actually hangs around for a while after you exit the shower. It leaves you smelling nice and tropical. From an aromatherapy perspective, it makes the shower experience really lovely. Couple of pumps on the old loofah, and it lathers up extremely well for full body coverage. I can't stand body washes that require half the bottle to maintain a good lather. This one is not one of those. It cleans very nicely, and does a bang up job of leaving me feeling nicely hydrated as well. So the natural moisture from my skin is not stripped away, and I'm left feeling clean and smelling wonderful. I actually lost it to my wife, who gave it a try and insisted that it was no longer mine, and that I was not allowed to touch it. Because I consider myself a gentleman, I gave in to her demands, and sadly gave her all of the wonderful shower experiences going forward from that point on.

I like to add it to a big glass of water. It does take a while to stir and dissolve completely. But it ends up dissolving. It doesn’t have a strong taste. I don’t taste anything at all. So that’s a positive thing for me. It doesn’t disrupt my stomach. I don’t get any aches from this at all. My skin is definitely looking a lot clearer and glowy. I don’t find much hair cut up in my comb like I used to. My nails are definitely stronger. Overall yes certain things have improved. But you have to be persistent to see results.",B08XQYZWCS,1629771854108,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Excellent hydrator,"I have to say, that my experience with Korean skin care products is really fantastic. I do have combination type skin with an oilier T zone, and drier areas that surround my chin. As such, I do find it difficult to find products that walk that fine line between exacerbating the oiliness and solving the dryness, or tamping down the oiliness and exacerbating the dryness. Hydrating products generally don't do too well for my T zone, but I need them for my dryer spots that surround my chin. This recovery cream works extremely well at hydrating the skin, and is a nice texture and consistency that saturates very well and doesn't leave the skin feeling greasy. That is key for me, because I was able to use it on all of my face, and not worry about exacerbating either issue that I have. I found that the finish that it left on my oilier t zone, was surprisingly matte, and not glossy at all. As for the dry areas around my chin, this cream did wonders. At first I thought to use it as a spot treatment cream for myself, using it only on my chin to hydrate the dry skin that I have there, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that I could use it on both my oily skin, and my dry skin. A little of this cream certainly goes a long way, as I only needed about a dime to a nickel sized amount, in order to cover my entire face. The flaking skin issues that I often have on my chin, were completely alleviated. In my experience, this is another hit for Korea's skin care industry. I found the packaging to be rather subdued, but certainly adequate enough considering the price point. That for me is another nice thing, as I found it to be fairly reasonably priced. All in all, my experience with it was tremendous, and so I would recommend it.",B08QVJ4NVD,1629571947128,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,It’s ok,"These were really hard to open. I just couldn’t get it right. I got the chance to try these for free thanks to the vine program. If I had paid for these I wouldn’t of been happy. I wasn’t really impressed with the product itself. I thought it wasn’t hydrating enough. And just for  seven days worth, i didn’t really see any improvements on my skin. It absorbs quickly and all but felt that my skin was really dry after half an hour. I think I was just expecting more that I ended up disappointed. I do have to say that it worked well with the rest of my products. I like to use retinol, glycolic acid and vitamin c. I didn’t get any burning sensation after applying this right after my retinol. I didn’t get any redness as well. I just would have wanted more hydration.",B08VQY1Z1S,1629331805390,3.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Great for everyday,"I live in sunny South Florida, so it's important that I do my best to try and protect my skin from the sun even with casual exposure. This is a very expensive and small quantity of sunscreen, but I think if you look at it for particular application it might be worth it. I used it entirely for a face sunscreen. It does extremely well to saturate into the skin and I didn't find it gave me a white cast at all, which is what I really appreciate about it. It can do very well as an everyday wearing type sunscreen that will give you protection from the sun, while at the same time moisturizing your skin. As a matter of fact, I found as a moisturizer it worked very well. I appreciate very much the sun protection SPF 50 that it has, because the sun where I live can certainly get very strong. I usually dislike sunscreens, because of the oily nature of them, but I found this one to be well balanced, and didn't leave me feeling greasy at all. I also found that it had a bit of a matte finish to it, so you didn't notice any sort of shining, especially for someone like me who tends to have an oilier t zone. In combination with that, I actually get dry areas on my chin, and this did very nicely to moisturize my dry areas while not causing any sort of exacerbation of oilier areas. All in all it's probably one of the best, if not the best sunscreen that I have ever used for my face. For everyday wear, and protection, I would certainly reach for this sunscreen without a doubt. I do recommend it.",B08NJ5BTWG,1629214068224,5.0
AFVOZ4UNUZKEQ7GTQ3IHQY7PZ5FA_1,Some of the best massaging solution out there,First of all the size of this is perfect because I don't have to worry about how much I'm using there's a ton here. And a little goes a long way it actually spreads out very evenly and has a lot of silky smooth characteristics. There is no smell very subtle scent and it's not too oily. It soaks into the skin eventually where you will want to apply more but like I said a little goes a long way definitely worth the investment and unless you're giving massages all day this will last a long time. The pump works effortlessly and so far whether I've massaged some of it into my own legs and shoulders or applied it on a friend or family member it has been a unanimous decision that this cream lotion boil for massaging is as good as it gets.,B08N5NDVGH,1651677002825,5.0
AFVOZ4UNUZKEQ7GTQ3IHQY7PZ5FA_1,Great feeling razor very stoked,I try all types of different razors and the ones I grew up using from the major companies are just not made with the same quality as they used to in my opinion. So when I found an interesting shaped kind of new school style I wanted to try it and I'm glad I did.

It is very moisturizing and the skin felt silky smooth after just one application.  It gives off sun protection for a while but i would definitely keep applying it throughout the day to keep it at SPF50.<br />Im glad it doesnt have the popular bad chemical sunscreen ingredients but it does list a lot of chemical ingredients ive never heard of.  I hope these are not harmful.  i will have to do more research another time,B08NJ5BTWG,1618007704440,5.0

AGS4KJHF5LOOWT2A5TJJFMB24VOA,Runny consistency,"1.7 ounces of moisturizing face cream in a compact glass jar. While the cream does deliver a nice moisturized finish I found the 'cream' to be more of a runny liquid than anything else and had me questioning the possibility of whether this was a bad batch due to an unpleasant fragrance tinge reminiscent of yeasty sake lees. Once applied to the skin its not a big deal, however there are much better options at this price point without such initial unpleasant qualities.",B09FNTZFZZ,1640663357523,3.0

AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,Wear over black to help with sheer formula,"So pretty! I love the holo paired with the multichrome magnetic polishes! That being said, the pigment is fairly thin on these polishes, while the formula is pretty thick. They’re still easy enough to work with, but I would likely recommend wearing them over a black polish.<br />I show them in one coat with no magnet (obviously very sheer), and with a magnetic coat on top of that (still pretty sheer, but better). I feel they’re slightly pricy for how sheer the formula is, but I would still recommend them because they’re so pretty, and I’ve found Homost to be a pretty reliable brand in the couple of sets I’ve ordered from them. They all cure within 60 seconds. Just know, their bottles feel super tiny, and their brush is definitely very short and small.",B09BKK8G76,1644128415315,4.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,2-3 coats,"This is a great little set! It’s a neon set, and the colors are for sure neon. One thing to note though - the first picture in the listing made me hope that the colors would have some shimmer in them, but they definitely don’t. Looking at the other pictures, this matches up, but that shimmer was the most noticeable thing to me in the first picture so I just thought I’d mention it.<br />These polishes do cure within 60 seconds, and give decent coverage. Most of them gave full coverage in two coats, but a couple (mainly the yellow), I’d consider a third coat for. Since the polishes are quite neon, are gel (meaning fast and easy to work with), and this is standard especially for yellow neons, I’m not upset about it. Honestly, when I added a top coat over just two coats, it ended up looking pretty good, but I’d still probably add that third coat just to be sure, because… It’s neon yellow. But, overall, I’m happy with the polishes! At 8 mL, they’re also a decent sized bottle for gel polishes.",B08W8LKLHB,1625971856890,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,"Beautiful, well-behaved polishes","These polishes were exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered Krisnice creme colors! One of them is actually more of a jelly polish, but it’s a stunning color, which you can definitely build up some opacity and depth with. The others are, as I said, exactly what I was hoping for. I’ve used this brand’s magnetic polishes before, but these cremes apply just as dreamily, and have absolutely excellent coverage! A couple of them were almost one coaters, but they’re all definitely perfect within two. And, they all cure within 60 seconds, so I couldn’t be happier with them!",B0895FHBVG,1619323590972,5.0

AGV2YW5B3SCKG6WV422CIITZOGRQ,Really rough - almost leaves micro scratches and too oily,"I’ve never used a salt scrub before so I was excited to try this. I usually just use sugar scrubs as they’re gentle and they smell great. However, with this scrub - it’s very rough. I absolutely wasn’t expecting to be so rough. I had gotten a decent amount on my wash cloth and rubbed it on my leg and immediately noticed that it was causing like little micro scratches. The salt flakes are really coarse and uncomfortable to rub against the skin. It’s suppose to exfoliate not rub off the skin. Like goodness. I started using it on my calloused feet and it didn’t really hurt and made a little bit of a difference. But as for like legs, arms and things like that? I definitely wouldn’t use it on those places. It also leaves a thick film/residue. Much too oily in my opinion. It does smell nice though but overall, I’m just not impressed unfortunately. Maybe if the salt flakes were a lot more fine and not so much oil but otherwise, I wouldn’t recommend. Also, it’s price tag is a bit high for a smaller jar.",B09KX5N1DR,1650191781414,2.0
