AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,Great for at home use and so easy to use!,This is perfect for my between salon visits. I have been using this now twice a week for over a month and I absolutely love it! My skin looks amazing and feels super smooth and silky. This is also super easy to use (just follow instructions). I can see already that I will begin expanding the time between visits which will definitely help me save money in the long run. Highly recommend!,B08P2DZB4X,1627391044559,5.0
AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,A little goes a long way!,"This is a really nice moisturizing lotion. It goes on lightly and is readily absorbed into my skin. My skin feels amazingly softer and smoother and allows for a nice base for my makeup to be applied over. You only need a small pea sized amount to cover your entire face and neck. Highly recommend for all skin types, ages and for women as well as men.",B07RBSLNFR,1621184430697,5.0
AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,Just ok,"I try to get Keratin treatments every 3 months, but honestly it has been getting costly. So, when I saw this I was excited to try it. I found it difficult to use and almost impossible to get to saturate the back of my hair and straight iron it the way they do in the salon. Front and sides were ok, but I couldn't maneuver the back to get it straight. Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment. I did, however, use the shampoo and conditioner (and I still am). I wish they sold the S&C separate because I really did like it and I am always in the market for a good hair wash which won't strip my hair between treatments. I will resume my regular treatments at my salon.",B07SLFWZKN,1619737501209,3.0
AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,Good quality hair brush!,"Really nice small brush. Made well, nice wood made with boar bristle, my son absolutely loves this. It brushes his hair well and keeps him looking his best. This compact size makes it nice to keep in the center console of his car or to take on vacation with him. Highly recommend!",B08JTNQFZY,1617904219785,5.0
AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,Great all natural ear swabs!,"I really like these ear swabs. First they come in a large, handy box and are easy to store (will last a long time). Second, they are all organic and good for the environment. Third, they are strong and don't fall apart very easily. I highly recommend these over Q-Tips (which I have used for years).",B07KG1TWP5,1596473351088,5.0
AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,Wonderful overnight cream!,"To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.",B07W397QG4,1593352422858,5.0
AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,Nice manicure set for men or women,"This a really cute kit which would make for a great gift for someone. It is in a little leather like pouch and has everything you need to give yourself a quality manicure. The nail clipper is a perfect size and works just as well on a women or man's nails. The file is nice as well (although I still prefer to use emory boards on mine). I actually bought another one of these to give to my son as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas for him to use at college. Just a nice, quality made kit at a reasonable price.",B07J3GH1W1,1547589356557,5.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Pleasant Scent,"This perfume by Shakira has a pleasant scent. I can detect sweet and spicy notes in it. It is not very strong, which is good. It definitely fades over the course of the day, but I can still detect light whiffs at the end of the day. The bottle is attractive, but the cap or lid is way too plain. You have the sexy body shaped bottle and then there's a little clear plastic lid that has not aesthetics at all. If you could be the lid to anything and doesn't stand out at all.",B0BTJ6SYKB,1623188037011,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Refreshing!,"I like wearing eye masks such as these. They are refreshing and energizing. I store them in my small beauty refrigerator which makes them even more enjoyable. After wearing them, I felt ready to take on the world! It comes with a little spatula so you can take them out of the jar without touching them. It felt like they were slipping as I wore them, but when I went to the bathroom to remove them, they were still in place where I left them. One thing I like about this type of eye mask is that it's easy to go about your day while wearing them. I didn't have any issues with sensitivity thankfully. My eyes are super sensitive.",B08KWN77LW,1610133666100,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,My First Scrunchie!,"This is my first scrunchie. I have not had my hair cut in about 9 months because of the pandemic, so my hair has gotten longer than I've worn it in years! I'm in my early 50's and it's a little below my shoulders now. My hair is thick and coarse. It's long enough to wear in a messy bun for the first time in years! The scrunchie is easy to use and holds up my thick hair pretty well. I don't have to readjust it because it's falling. You can feel the coils inside the fabric. I find it fascinating how it works. When I take it off, it shrinks up again. I like it!",B08HXQ3T9K,1607744901734,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Great for Travel!,"I recently took the Pinrose fragrance quiz on their website and this was the scent that was recommended for me. It's okay. I don't dislike it. I definitely don't love it. It's a musky floral scent. Floral scented fragrances are not my favorites. I prefer either fruity or sweet. This supposedly has peach notes in it, but I don't detect them. Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals. They're basically scented towelettes. They are fairly dry so you're not dripping in scent. I'm planning on putting some of these in my daughter's Christmas stocking. These are also great for travel!",B0B2L218H2,1605885919061,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Fun Way to Try Out a New Scent,"These Pinrose Gilded Fox petals are a fun way to try out a new scent! The box comes with 12 packets. Each packet has a fragrance infused towelette. They aren't too wet, but you are able to rub or wipe them on your pulse points or wherever and transfer the scent to your body. This one has a very interesting smell. At first I didn't detect the chocolate, so it's a bit subtle. The smell is a powdery sweetness with a hint of chocolate. I threw away the wipe in my office trash can and caught pleasant whiffs of it throughout the day. Since the box comes with so many, I plan to put some in my daughter's Christmas stocking so she can try them out. They would also be great for traveling.",B0B2L218H2,1605814409168,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,A Bit Oily,"I am in my early fifties and my morning skincare routine calls for Vitamin C serum. This doesn't smell like most other Vitamin C serums that I have used. It has a neutral scent that doesn't linger. The serum consistency is thick, but runny. It's a bit oily and doesn't absorb quickly. My skin can be sensitive at times, but I didn't have any problems with this. Overall, I like it, but I don't love it.",B08BZ1RHPS,1597942744359,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Good Variety of Travel Size Skincare Products,"It's difficult to find some targeted skincare products in travel sizes. I can usually find cleansers and moisturizers, but serums and eye creams are not so easy to track down. This travel set comes with a foaming cleanser, an eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer as well as a beauty spritz. I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me. The scents were light and floral. None of the products were irritating. I have sensitive eyes and skin and nothing bothered them. I do think the kit is a bit pricey, but that's not affecting my review.",B085NYYLQ8,1597526701753,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Comfortable Head Band,"I work at home, so I can't get by without wearing a face mask for a good part of the day, but I do wear one if I am going out. I have had issues with some masks not staying over my ears. This is a good way to utilize those masks. The  headband is comfortable and light weight. It has some stretch to it. The buttons are a little loose, so I tightened them before I wore the headband out in public. I found that I had to pay attention to how I was putting it on my head so the buttons were even, otherwise my mask was crooked. It's definitely a helpful item.",B088FBNQXW,1593043740906,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Good Hand Sanitizer!,"For a new (or at least new to me) brand of hand sanitizer, I am pleased with it. I like the pump dispenser which is easy to use. The bottles are a good size. While you can detect the smell of the alcohol, it's not too strong or overpowering like some can be.  With so many new brands out there these day, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.",B087D7MVHB,1591977214185,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Light Weight,"This is a light weight serum. It has a runny, liquidy consistency that's non-greasy. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or tackiness. There is no scent to it either. It absorbs really fast and immediately hydrates your skin. It leaves a smooth finish. It's non-irritating and doesn't annoy my sensitive skin.",B083TLNBJJ,1585261263214,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Soft,"I wear headbands like this in the evening when washing my face and following my skincare routine. These headbands are very soft. I found these to be a little small, but they do stretch enough to accommodate my large head. I have just had other headbands that were a little larger and didn't require being stretched to the max just to fit. I like the variety of colors and have shared these with my eighteen year old daughter. One thing that I do like is that the bow doesn't get off centered as easily as my old one. My old one has to be adjusted every time I put it on. This one seems to be just fine.",B082NKQ4ZT,1583932042329,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Nice Fruity Scent,"This serum is more the consistency of a lotion than serums that I have used in the past. It has a nice fruity smell. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. The serum absorbs quickly and isn't tacky or sticky. I am in my early fifties and use an assortment of anti-aging products daily. I haven't seen any new miraculous results with this, but it does moisturize. As a regular user of such products, I really don't think I would see anything new from them, but rather a continuation of what I have already started to achieve.",B07WNBZQGT,1581772960365,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Non-Greasy,"I apply body lotion every morning and night. This one is a thinner lotion than some, but it absorbs quickly. My skin just drinks it up! It's non-greasy and has a light, pleasant scent to it. The bottle is a little oddly shaped. It's thin and flat which makes it a little difficult to grip in my opinion.",B07SW7D6ZR,1580742144072,4.0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,Gentle!,"This goat milk cleanser is very gentle. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate or annoy my skin at all. It has a pump dispenser that works nicely. It's thick, like a lotion consistency. The cleanser doesn't lather or foam. I haven't been able to notice any scent, good or bad. It doesn't dry out my skin. I'm very pleased with it.",B07NPWK167,1578928089878,5.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Works great,Great shampoo and conditioner set. Smells great and leaves hair feeling clean and soft. I like this brand and have used it in the past. Seems to be great quality.,B08XJWLLKQ,1618934798418,5.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Work well for light hold,This is much faster and less messy than using the cream. Quick any easy. Not the longest hold but good for a few hours. Not much of any smell to it which is probably better. Some of these wax's are way too fragrant.,B08PLFZB89,1617909095488,5.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Works great,Great soap with mild natural scent. Works great on my sensitive skin. Leaves it soft and clean and doesn’t dry it out.,B08KHRF9NY,1616954539796,5.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Works great,Great quality soap! So many good ingredients that are good for skin and hydrating not drying. Smells great and skin feels clean and soft after. Highly recommend.,B08N6YHQXT,1616457223039,5.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Prefer fingers,These are so popular and I was excited to try but I don’t feel like it did it for me. It was hard to get down to my scalp and move around. Felt much easier to just use my fingers. Maybe I need to practice more of try a different massager. They seem well made though and look just like the picture.,B08SQ31H8P,1615701950469,4.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Small but Works great,Tiny waver that works great to make smaller sized waves. Heats quickly and makes waves quickly. Only took a few minutes to do all of my daughters hair.  I only do a top layer of hair and around the face. Find that it looks less poofy this way. Seems well made and good quality.,B08NPBQR9L,1609182507469,5.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Don’t grab well,"These look like nice tweezers, similar in look to tweezerman tweezers but for some reason they don’t grip hairs very well and are very annoying for me. They seem to match up perfectly at the end so not sure why they don’t grab well. Will use as backups or keep in purse or car.",B08BLX72TP,1606878884208,3.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Great oils,Great set of oils that are great to use as is or when making other products. I used the coconut oil in a roller ball with some tea tree and clove oil for a rash and it works great. They are both have no scent.,B08LYT4Q2X,1606103453308,5.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Works great,Great set of hair items. Would make a nice gift. Works as described. The material is extremely plush and soft and feels luxurious to wear.,B0841WQNNZ,1604762653089,5.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Works well,Decent shampoo. I used it alone without conditioner so I could see how it worked and it seemed to clean my hair well and leave it manageable. The scent is ok as well. While I didn’t notice anything negative there wasn’t anything that stood out to me to buy it again.,B087ZQK2G8,1598591443230,4.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Works great,I have been wanting to try these food peels. I was nervous to try but after reading some of the other reviews I finally did and am glad I did. Followed directions and my feet started to peel the next day. No bad reactions or problems. I didn’t use the included tool. Soaking your feet each day helps with the peeling process.,B087Z9X39L,1594848248797,5.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Gel sunscreen,"Interesting sunscreen. Has a clear gel  consistency, goes and smooth and easily. Rubs in great and dries quickly, smells first of running alcohol and then berry. Seems to be effective in preventing sunburns.",B084ZHP45Y,1585080133476,4.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Works great,"This is a nice cordless, travel size waterpik. It has good power for not being a regular waterpik. Some other cordless ones I’ve tried haven’t had the same power. This comes with a variety of tips. Is easy to fill and use. Has different settings and power levels. Charges via a usb cable.",B07LCHCD6Q,1556652791507,4.0
AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,Works well,"Clippers work well. I prefer to use them without the plastic catcher that is attached, but it easily comes off. Nice travel case that includes a nail file. Clippers are very sharp and cut efficiently and smoothly.",B07J3GH1W1,1544671031249,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Fragrance is subtle but lovely and floral; just enough to freshen up an area or relax to,"This is a nice room freshener. The fragrance is subtle but lovely and floral. Some fragrances give me a headache if they are too strong but this one does not. I love spraying this in my bedroom. It is also a great fragrance to relax with before falling asleep--no dangerous scented candle needed. It does not help promote sleep for me but it is soothing to my senses. The aroma does not last long--about 15 minutes. I happen to like fragrance, so I do like this linen spray.",B08T7GPT1D,1625006698955,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Very functional basic brush set; wish handles were longer; love the bristle color,"There are 9  soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />Each brush comes individually packaged. In fact it is over packaged. The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel good against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. I do wish the handles were a tad longer. Nevertheless, the current price of $8.99 is an super reasonable for this set as it comes to $1 per brush.<br /><br />This is a perfect set for the young teenager starting out on her make-up journey.",B0919R1CYT,1624659702420,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Wafer-thin portable soap; dissolves instantly; good lather; fragrance does not come thru on hands,"There are three packages of wafer thin sheets of soap in 80 sheets each pack. The wafers are attached in the center but pull apart easily. There is also a sliding top tin supplied that will hole 80 sheets. Be careful not to get them wet as even a drop of water causes them to dissolve. When I washed my hands with one sheet, it created a nice lather and left my hands clean. I do not feel that it was moisturizing as claimed. Also, even though there are three wonderful fragrances (lavender & aloe, bergamot & ylang ylang, and jasmine & patchouli) that smell great as a whole 80 sheets, that fragrance does not come through on the hands because the soap is too thin to leave any fragrance behind.<br /><br />The current price of $13.95 comes to $.06 cents per sheet. I consider these perfect for when using a public restroom that has water but no soap. It is also great for camping or any place where portability is paramount without carrying a full wet bar of soap in a container.",B09473GGM4,1624274497670,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Lightweight moisturizer that mildly moisturized my body; good for the summer - 3.5 stars,"There are four individually packaged 2.53 fluid ounce tubes of moisturizer in this set. They are all the same tubes. This moisturizer is lightweight and is mildly hydrating. It absorbs quickly and is a good product to use in the summer. I also like the fresh cucumber-like aroma.  I did, however, expect this to be more hydrating than it is. It is a decent cream but not excellent.<br /><br />The current price of $15.00 comes to a reasonably priced $3.75 per tube.",B08LPGZMQK,1623116811042,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Nice set of 7 iridescent scrunchies; material can be slippery on hair,"There are six blush-colored scrunchies and one white scrunchie. The material is a bit slick so there is a chance these will slip out of the hair. I have medium length hair in the back and they did slip out easily if I pulled on them. I do feel these are elegant and super attractive. If the bride and bridesmaids all have long hair, then these are a good option. I have no idea what these will be priced at but anything more than $10.50 (which would be 1.50 each) is too much.",B08YNR839W,1620424267961,3.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Beautiful shower cap that fits perfectly on my head but bow doesn’t look good on me,"I love this shower cap. It is very attractive and the black and white colors just pop. I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and take a size small in a cap. This fits me perfectly and there is a little more room for more hair if I had it. This is comfortable and does keep my hair dry in the shower. Unfortunately, I hate the way the bow looks on me.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 is on the high side of competitively priced.",B09GNXK3N1,1618184630323,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Simple headbands that loosely grip my head;wish there were more color variety,"There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink, purple, and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red, black, and brown in this set. However, this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.<br /><br />I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.",B08QHP717Z,1614292707452,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Exceptionally well-made and beautiful pocket sized brush,"This is an exceptionally well-made and beautiful brush in a travel size. The brush and handle are small, so this brush is not as easy to grasp as one that is full sized. However, It detangles and brushes through my curls with ease. I also did not experience the typical loss of bristles I usually do with a boar bristle brush. Most animal hair brushes seem to shed for a while and then stop shedding. So far I have not had that problem.<br /><br />I actually cannot believe this is priced at $7.29 because most boar bristles brushes of this size are in the $28 to $30 range. The price, coupled with the style, finish, and functionality of this hairbrush is outstanding in my opinion.",B08JTNQFZY,1614036953464,5.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,"Excellent empty glass bottle set perfect for hair coloring, essential oil sprays, etc.","There are two amber glass spray bottles in this set. In addition, four black labels, one stainless steel funnel, one glass eye dropper, one white marker, and two standard black caps are included. It is important to go through all the packaging in order to find these items as I almost missed a few. Note that these are packaged exceptionally well in double bubble wrap sleeves for each bottle.<br /><br />These are perfect for hair solutions, water, window cleaner, vinegar, etc., etc., etc. The spray nozzles, with a turn of the front dial, dispense a wonderful mist spray or a fine stream just like many store bought spray products. Each bottle holds 16 ounces of liquid. The amber color of the glass helps protect light sensitive products. <br /><br />The current price of $18.98 is competitive but somewhat pricey for this set as it comes to $9.50 per bottle not counting the added incidentals.  Their [[ASIN:B08HGZXLP6 four-pack of bottles]] is about $1 cheaper per bottle.",B08HGZXLP6,1611360452090,5.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Super soft back brush that lathers reasonably well & cleans well but is not exfoliating,"I have tried many different back brushes including this really good [[ASIN:B08HR2GBHC Kozis brush]] and the buff puff type that lather copiously. However, this one's bristles differ substantially. They are very fine and as soft as a cat's fur.  The soap lathers reasonably well on the bristles and the brush feels great against my skin. It is solidly built. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the title says this is exfoliating and I do not consider that an attribute of this brush. The bristles are too soft to exfoliate. However, it cleans well and feels great to use. I consider it 5 stars for that purpose.  The current price of $16.99 is on the pricey side but I have no similar brush of this bristle style to compare it to. It is certainly not competitively priced with other back brushes which are about $7 cheaper.",B08N9RT9YD,1611183336145,4.0

AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Creamy texture; nice fragrance; takes a while to absorb but is hydrating – 3.5 stars,"I am not sure what a balancing cream is supposed to be. Nevertheless, I applied this to my face and neck (avoiding the eye area). I like the creamy texture and the fragrance is decent. The aroma reminds me a little bit of St. Joseph's aspirin. It did take about ten minutes to absorb fully, but once it did my face and neck felt incredibly hydrated.<br /><br />Note that there are no English instructions on the jar or the box except for the words ""balancing cream."" This is made in Korea and it is written in Korean. If it were not for the Amazon label, no one would know that this is a hydrating face and neck cream. Also, there is no mention of how many ounces this is but I suspect it is about 4 ounces based on the price per ounce listed on Amazon.  The current price of $22.65 is pricey but competitive for this cream. I like it but not enough to order it again.",B08P7PSMRR,1610322554727,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,"Vegetal, messy flower balls; not sure why anyone would use this for anything but tea","I thought these were bath bombs when I ordered them. However, that is not what this is at all. There are 10 tiny balls of compressed flowers wrapped in various colored foils. They can be used as a tea, which is what I use them for, or they can be put in a bath. I have no idea how anyone would use this for baking as per the Amazon title.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all but the purple and red balls have a purely vegetal scent. The purple and red smell flowery. I have used tea balls before and never cared for them but did like how most stayed together. However, these balls expand into many little flower particles that float in the water. If one were to put this in a bath, it would clog the drain unless the flower debris was scooped out with a skimmer.  I used the blue ball to brew into a tea and it was tasteless. I also had to use a strainer and remove the lid on my pot to keep the spout from clogging.<br /><br />Besides the mess and lackluster flavor, there are absolutely no brewing instructions, no information on what tea ball is what flower.  The Amazon site has a list of the flower and the balls but does not show the foil color. It is almost impossible to reconcile that list with what is in front of me.<br /><br />Shame on the vendor for not creating an insert or package label that says what is inside and which tea ball is what flower. I personally do not care for this at all and will probably throw this in the garbage.<br /><br />This is not worth it to me at any price. It is certainly not a bath bomb, I can't see how it can be used for baking, and as a tea it is tasteless and messy. There is no fragrance, so its use as a bath bomb would be for romantic or ambiance purposes only.<br /><br />At the current price of $9.88 for 10 balls it comes to almost $1 per tea ball.",B08KT7FCYY,1609804845102,2.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Very nice clip & hair tie set but clipswill break easily,"This is a very nice set of 6 clips, 10 hair ties, and a case. The clips are strong and do hold a generous amount of hair. I like the non-slippery feeling of the clip itself. The ties are ordinary but still functional. The reason I rated this 3 stars is because I also ordered this same set with the blue clips and tan ties. One of the clips in that order broke immediately which tells me these won't last.<br /><br />The current price of $7.19 is reasonable for this set but just be aware that the clips will break easily because the plastic is not that strong. ",B08HMLXW65,1608329596770,3.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Excellent keychain carriers; 2 spray bottles dispense fine mist; flip top ones only okay – 4.5 stars,"I am highly impressed with this set, particularly the keychain carriers. The carriers are larger than I expected and the flag colors are vibrant, attractive, and patriotic. The pocket in the carrier stretches to accept either the spray bottle or flip top ones.<br /><br />There are six keychains with carabiners and the flag carriers. Also included are six flip-top bottles and two pump spray bottles. The pump spray bottles dispense a fine mist depending on what I put into them (perfume, hand sanitizer, etc.). The flip-top bottles can dispense hand sanitizer, hand cream, etc. However, since they are hard, I have to hit the bottle against my hand to dispense any cream as it is not conducive to squeezing.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can put my own travel bottle (if similarly sized) into these keychain carriers. In addition, I can put in a chapstick (see photo), nail clipper, etc.<br /><br />The current price of $7.10 is reasonable for this set.",B08G83G24X,1606518368441,5.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Has a spicy aroma; leaves my hair nourished and enhanced my curls (see update),"This shampoo and conditioner travel-size duo (2 ounces each bottle) has a spicy aroma that is neither pleasant nor offensive but not my favorite smell.  The shampoo produces a medium lather and cleans well. The conditioner is creamy and conditions well. When my hair dried, it had a sheen to it and was well nourished and my curls were enhanced.<br /><br />The current price of $14 for this set is expensive. If this had an intoxicating fragrance I liked and was more reasonably priced, I would have loved it. However, this is not a set I would buy at this price.<br /><br />Note that I get about four uses to this set for my short to medium hair.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/22/20 - This only lasted me three uses. However, I had such trouble getting both the remaining shampoo and conditioner (particularly the conditioner) out of the bottle. They need to change this to a squeeze tube. I actually had to fill the bottle with water several times to dislodge the remaining ingredients. Also, the conditioner makes the floor of the shower or tub very slippery (almost as if I put Pledge on a floor).  Based on this, I lowered my ranking from 4 to 2 stars.",B086XH7BWW,1599882609367,2.0

There are 16 to the package and the boards are triple thickness compared to the standard personal-sized ones I am use to. However, the gritty surface on mine started to wear off after a few swipes of my nails over the board. Emery boards in general do not last long; however, the size and thickness coupled with the limited longevity makes me not like these.

This absolutely infuriates me. I was able to open the conditioner.  I removed plastic seal on the top of both bottles and turned as specified on the bottle. I spent 10 minutes trying to open the shampoo. Unless I take a hammer and chisel to it or an exacto knife, I can't use the shampoo.<br /><br />The conditioner is nice and has a subtle fresh aroma but without the pair, this is zero stars to me when I cannot get to the product.",B07VGBBNTH,1581997877865,1.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Versatile set of four combs that look and feel like plastic,"This is a nice set of combs--one wide-tooth and one sort of fine-tooth with two regularly-spaced ones. I know others mentioned that they found the combs to be sharp on the edges when combing. The one wide-tooth comb has blunted tines but the other three have pointed tines. However, those pointed tine ones were not sharp on my scalp. I have short to medium fine curly hair and these passed through my hair easily (wet or dry) and I did not feel scratched. I actually like the points massaging my scalp because on the combs I received, they were not super sharp.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot tell if this set is wooden as it claims. It is possible they are wooden but because they are highly polished, they feel and look like plastic. I attend craft shows and it is possible to get a plastic feel and look to wood, so unless I broke one of the combs in half (which I am unwilling to do), I cannot tell. I still think the current price of $9.99 is reasonable even they are plastic.",B081ZN3TD5,1581257263753,4.0

The colors are muted but are perfect for casual wear. The black bands (one beaded and one not) are suitable for both business and casual attire.<br /><br />These are about two inches wide and do feel relatively comfortable on. Note that the beaded bands are a bit bouffanty due to the thickness of the cloth with the extra height of the beads. Unfortunately, these are not my style. If one is in the market for this type of accessory, they are fully functional with a little bit of statement. The cloth is wrapped securely around the outer edge of the band and appears they will last a while. The current price of $16.99 is reasonable for this set.",B0837K9W6P,1580949934338,4.0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,Relatively strong water flosser but reservoir is attached which makes drying it nearly impossible,"I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]].  I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.",B07LCHCD6Q,1556243557316,4.0

AFQQQ5LGNSQUEBGDCYBAZZE5T3DA,Deep Hydration,"There's a Chinese actress who attributes her perfect skin to twice-daily sheet masks. After using one per night for several months, I totally believe they work. This mask is the best for hydration. It can be used by all skin types. The sheet is soft and flexible. You can stretch it as needed. I always stretch the eye holes since I have larger eyes. It also prevents the serum from dripping in your eyes. Another tip is to rub the mask on the backs of your hands before throwing it away. That skin needs special care also. The best part about this set is that you get so many masks. You can try using one nightly to see how it changes your skin. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

Some are slightly unexpected in a skincare product. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbed. It doesn't just sit on top of the skin.

AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,Crisp and Refreshing!,"I LOVE Hask hair products. I'm a huge fan and have been for some time. So, I was super excited test Hask's body wash.  But I had a problem right from the start. I had to decide between 4 fantastic choices!  Coconut, Lavender + Vanilla, Cucumber + Aloe and Shea + Cocoa Butter. Since it was very warm outside the day I ordered and with summer rapidly approaching, I chose Cucumber + Aloe.<br /><br />Perfect choice!<br /><br />This is a 2 pack of 24.5oz Hask Cucumber + Aloe Body wash. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. The bottle's pump dispenses easily as well as a  good amount of body wash. It lathers quickly and does a great job of cleansing skin.  I also use it while shaving my legs and it works well.  When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.  The aloe helps hydrate and moisturize my dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />The 2 bottles are big in size and will last for quite some time in our home.

With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier.  It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask.  I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job!  It applies nice and easy.  I let it sit on my skin for 10 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water, right before its nearly dry.  It exfoliates well leaving my skin soft, smooth , a bit brighter and healthy. Dead skin cells are washed away.  My skin literally feels GOOD after using Huxley.  This mask does have a light scent but it doesn't last long. It is recommended Huxley be used 1-3 times a week. I use it twice a week though I could probably get away with using it only a week because the results Huxley delivers are long lasting.<br /><br />I'm so relieved I will be able to continue to use this mask on my skin. Silly as it may sound  I kind of feel like I'm pampering myself when I use it-it makes my skin feel that GOOD!

I'm so happy I ordered it.<br /><br />A nice, thin line of the wash dispenses from the tube.  (The tube is very sturdy and durable, for those interested in packaging) Now, the wash starts out like a kind of lotion but it lathers quickly and easily into a light, whipped foam. ( A dime size amount is all I need to sufficiently cover my face/forehead.  ) The whipped foam is SO creamy and it just feels so darn good as I apply it and when its on my face.  IDK if its possible but I swear I can feel it cleaning, hydrating and moisturizing my skin pretty much immediately.  After I rinse with lukewarm water and pat my skin dry with a towel, my skin is soft, smooth, clean and has  a bit of a glow.  It looks and feels so good and healthy. It feels fresh.  And it feels that way long after I've used Easydew.  Easydew leaves my skin feeling like it did when I was younger-before I used makeup, before I spent too much time in the sun unprotected.  It feels revived and I just love that feeling!  Everything about this daily wash is perfect in my book.  It works great and makes my skin look/feel great. The ingredients and what they do for skin is impressive. (I recommend taking a minute to read the info above regarding the ingredients!)  The scent is wonderful (though it vanishes VERY quickly).  And I have no issues using it on my dry, very sensitive skin.  The price is more than reasonable, especially with the results the wash brings and the fact only a small amount is needed when I wash my face.  Easydew is officially  a part of my daily skin care  routine now.  I absolutely recommend Easydew!",B07YS9W97B,1610765636781,5.0
AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,SO Many Uses For Both Oils! I LOVE Them!,"I am finding SO many uses for Shiny Leaf's coconut and sweet almond oil! I do have some experience with coconut oil but this is my first time using sweet almond oil.  Thanks the labels on the bottles, reviews and internet searches, I'm finding SO many ways to use these oils...sometimes together, sometimes individually.<br /><br />Because I have terribly dry, sensitive skin, my main goal was to see how one or both oils could help protect my skin, especially now that winter has arrived and my skin is REALLY taking a beating.  Both oils work well to hydrate and moisturize, so I mixed a few ounces of each in a mist bottle. After I bathe, I mist  a combo of the oils over my skin to help hydrate and moisturize. The oils absorb quickly and do not leave an oily/greasy look OR feel to my skin.  I'm already seeing a decrease in my dry skin/itchy red patches of skin. I experience NO discomfort whatsoever when misting these oils onto my sensitive skin.  Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. In addition to using my combo of oils after bathing, I also give my hair a spray or two with the mister and sure enough, I'm seeing less hair in the drain and on my hairbrush after brushing. My hair is soft, smooth and shiny WITHOUT looking or feeling oily/greasy from the oil combo.<br /><br />I use the coconut oil (alone) to help remove makeup, under and around my eyes to soften and reduce fine lines, I rub a small amount into my scalp (as does my husband) to help stimulate hair growth, on the kid's faces after their baths to soften (especially in cold weather!), on my nail beds every couple of days and a light amount on any patches of eczema/red skin.  (It relieves the itching/burning and redness from eczema quickly!)<br /><br />I use the sweet almond oil (alone) on  dark circles under my eyes, a SMALL amount on split ends in my hair, a drop on chapped lips, I'm just starting to tinker with it for aromatherapy purposes.  I recently learned that it can help fade scars so I've begun to rub some sweet almond oil into a scar on my finger to see what happens. If it helps, I'll then move on to a small facial scar I have. I'm also trying something on my own; just started doing this a few days ago.  I get nosebleeds every single day, at least once a day, throughout the winter when the heat is on in the house. This started when I was 2 years old, I'm now 49 so I've experienced this my entire life.  I now rub a small amount of sweet almond oil under my nostrils before bed.  Since starting this, I continue to have nosebleeds. Yesterday, I had only one and it involved just a few drops of blood. I didn't whip through numerous tissues like normal.  ONE tissue took care of it. (that's huge for me!) I have NO clue if its just a coincidence or if the sweet almond oil is helping in any way but I'm going to continue using it.<br /><br />These oils are phenomenal! Both bottles are 16oz.  I love the fact that they have normal caps on them but pumps for each bottle are included as well.  The liquid of each is thinner oil than I expected, which I prefer.  Both absorb quickly. Neither has a scent.  I've found SO many uses for these oils, I can't wait to discover more. ( I'm SO happy with these oils, I recently purchased Shiny Leaf's biotin hair conditioner and cannot wait to try it! ) I find the price to be incredibly reasonable, especially since you're getting TWO bottles of oils! HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />*FYI...the mist bottle on the end in my photo is NOT included! I used one of my  own mist bottles to combine both oils.  You will get both bottles AND pumps that you see in my photo, NOT the mist sprayer!",B08LYT4Q2X,1607202914733,5.0
AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,Not The Right Mud Mask For Me,"The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state  those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. Because I have  sensitive skin that's precisely what  I did.  I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes.  Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask.  Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face.  In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all.  After I rinse it off (it rinses without issue), my skin feels clean but a bit dry. I cannot detect any change to my pores.  This just isn't the mud mask for me. I've discontinued using it and will be giving the rest to my niece over the holidays.

He's not yet noticed a reduction to his fine lines though he hasn't been using the lotion very long but he is pleased with the job its doing to help moisturize his skin.  His skin isn't nearly as dry as it had been so he is experiencing some much needed relief.  He is a fan of the scent and he's happy that the lotion doesn't cause his skin to look or feel oily/greasy.

AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,"Softens, Smooths and Soothes Skin","I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time  he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing  (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy.  lol.  While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my skin to look or feel oily or greasy. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I noticed in the info provided above, this lotion can be used after spending time in the sun. Because my skin is so terribly sensitive and dry, I do believe I will use LA LA Leaf after spending time outside in the sun when the weather gets warmer. Regardless of where you use LA LA Leaf on your body, its going to leave you with soft, smooth skin and will do so quickly.  I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. It doesn't take much lotion to cover the skin (in the areas we are using it on) so this tube is going to last us a decent amount of time. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf. It's wonderful",B08BB3P4VQ,1601706559533,5.0

That is precisely what I had in mind when I ordered Follain Mattifying Moisturizer.  I have dry, sensitive skin but its not oily. My husband has oily skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My husband does not.  Because Follain moisturizer promises to combat oily skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles and is a clean, vegan product, I ordered it to find out if it could help the both of us with our skin issues.  I'm happy to tell you that it has helped the both of us.  The moisturizer is a bit thinner than I'm used to. I don't say that in a bad way because its not at all bad.  One pump of the canister delivers enough moisturizer to cover my facial skin. Its very lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a look or feel of oily/greasy skin. It provides immediate hydration and does a nice job of softening my skin. I am VERY happy to say I absolutely have a noticeable reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. They don't go away entirely, but there is a definite reduction in size and appearance. ( I can't tell you how much I needed to experience this right now as my 49th bday is this week...that means 5-0 isn't far behind and I'm kind of starting to freak about it! )  My husband also tried this for his oily skin with impressive results.  Follain controls his oily skin and prevents the shiny, damp look that comes with oily skin thanks to the mattifying benefit of this moisturizer.  We both use it as needed and not even on a daily basis.  Follain works and it works well. We're both very pleased and grateful for the results!",B08CL46XNM,1599947601009,5.0

I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help.  The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothing<br /><br />Day 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skin<br /><br />Day 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feet<br /><br />Day 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin! (unfortunately, I had already started to peel off the skin when I remembered to take a picture for this review...the picture does not show just how much peeling had actually taken place)<br /><br />Day 5-Very little peeling-mainly on toes<br /><br />Day 6-Next to no peeling<br /><br />Day 7 & 8-No peeling at all<br /><br />Results:<br /><br />The bottom of my feet are soft and pink with the exception of my heels. Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked.

AGAM2CCKV52HI4YZU7ASZTSXA7YQ,Took Care of My Brassy Hair the First Time I Used It!,"A few weeks ago, I tried a different brand of purple conditioner. This was the first time I'd ever used any purple conditioner on my blond hair. After using the other brand, I noticed a subtle change to the brassiness in my hair. While I was satisfied with the results, I also assumed it had done all it could do for my hair.  Tonight, I tried WELLUTION Purple Hair Mask (for blonds).  The mask is easy to apply and it distributes nice  and even on my hair. My hair is thick and shoulder length. It didn't take much mask to cover all of my hair. ( I did put extra mask on my roots/scalp area because I do dye my roots) I let the mask sit on my hair for 10 minutes.  It has a nice scent to it that I very much like. I had no issues rinsing the mask from my hair. It rinsed out without issue. It did not cause my hair to look/feel oily or greasy. I was able to comb it without issue and let it air dry.  When my hair was completely dry it looked and felt nice and soft. My natural waves were present without flyaways.  But...I also noticed my hair was FAR less brassy than it had been.  The change was not subtle the way it was with the first brand I'd tried weeks ago.  This was very noticeable. To say that I""m pleased with this mask is an understatement. Its wonderful.  And I WILL continue to use it as needed.  Blonds, if you're dealing with brassy hair, give this mask a try. I hope it works for you as well as it did for me.",B089RLLT5C,1594605653363,5.0
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,"highly versatile, well made, effective shower cap. Fits my large head, and all my hair","An adorable shower cap that fits my large head. It says it fits up to 24"" head, and mine measures 23.5"". Then I have loads of hair- semi thick, nearly waist length. It all fits! Yet isn't a big bulbous excess of material either. But I am definitely pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply dont wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. I dont notice my hair getting wet at all, but I dont put my head in the water even with this on. I have a spray nozzle for washing and rinsing, so I guess I am able to control where the water reaches better.<br /><br />The fit is surprisingly good. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was skeptical, but am glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this. The little bow on top makes me feel like I went back in time to the 50s or something. Adorbs!<br /><br />I dont use it for keeping my hair out of face for make up or skin care, but it would certainly do well for that too. Also, if I had pool.. while it isnt a pool cap, if I just wanted something to help keep excess water off my hair while casually wading in a pool, this very well could work for that too.",B09GNXK3N1,1625843890463,5.0

I have been using it with their Real Ampoule Drops, which I rated a 4 at this time (4.5 if I could. ) as I need more time with it. However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich. I love how it feels, and how good my skin looks come morning. Little goes a long way. Maybe it is a combo of this and the drops (which instant absorb, and works well with this lotion).

This sunscreen feels quite gentle and does not seem to irritate my skin at all. It adds a light but effective level of hydration without feeling heavy. It is a chemical sunscreen, so zero white cast. It is thin, and goes on like a light lotion. Typical viscosity among my other K-beauty brands.<br /><br />I have a wide assortment of sunscreen, of various formulations and types. It is my #1 skin care product as I use it daily all year long. It is a habit. I avoid the sun for a few reasons, so sunscreen is vital to my well being. I live in a variable climate (from dry, freezing temps to humid hot) and I have sunscreen preference depending on season and situation. I tend to prefer mineral (my fair skin can handle any white cast) but do utilize chemical sunscreen often.<br /><br />I am going to like this for basic daily summer use. I tend to reduce my morning skin care routine down to a basic wash or splash of water and a moisturizing sunscreen. Since this offers SPF 50 (P++++), I know my skin is going to be pretty well protected. Since it feels like a moisturizer and goes on clear, I can skip my other skin care if I want. I tend to skip morning skin care in the summer because I am likely to just sweat it off anyway (I have a more involved night time routine to make up for it). So a sunscreen such as this is easy to use, makes my skin feel good, and easy to reapply throughout the day. I dont wear make up usually, but for sake of review I used it under a light foundation tint. Seems to play well- I didnt notice any rolling/pilling. I'll use it up.

It has some creamy lather, kinda foamy, feels nice to massage in, and rinses clean. Skin feels good. Not taut.<br /><br />Dont need much. First couple of times I squeezed out what I was used to using with some other cleansers. This is thick, and once you add in a little warm water it takes off with lather. If you end up not loving it for your face, it would make for a fabulous shaving cream and/or body wash. This tube will last a long while no matter what you use it for.<br /><br />I use a two step cleansing process most nights of the week. So that means starting off with an oil cleanser to help dissolve stubborn grime and products (primarily my SPF, but make up too), then using a gentle water based cleanser to actually wash away was was broken up and left behind. Some nights I can get away with just a water based cleanser. Mornings I use just water based cleansers. So really I can use this any time.",B07YS9W97B,1610819341130,5.0

This ""chalfont 303- a shimmering shade of pearl"" reminds more of a yellow tinged shimmery champagne rather than what I think of as pearl (white leaning pink). It is definitely not a white pink, too bad.  I may use it blended in with something, but it otherwise looks sallow on my fair, pink skin with blue undertones. I do however love the ease of use, how it does not irritate my eyes at all, and it just goes on so smoothly.",B08JCX3DL7,1610155682447,4.0

I use it as my first step in dissolving the grime and skin care products I used during the day (mostly SPF,  I dont wear makeup but rarely). I have dry skin, semi sensitive and this is soothing feeling as well as non irritating. The combo of Centella Asiatica (soothing, skin health) and Hyaluronic Acid (retaining moisture) are the clear winning ingredients in this awesome oil cleanser.<br /><br /> I dab this oil cleanser all over the face, then let the heat of my hands melt it into my skin. It quickly turns to a spreadable oil to massage in all over. I really like the solid balm to oils over the liquid oils as I find them easier to work with. They also seem to rinse away cleaner? I feel like I could use this Mizon oil balm as my only cleansing step, but I am rather used to doing a 2nd cleanse with a gentle cleanser to wash off any remaining dissolved gunk from the first wash. You'll have to try it out for yourself.<br /><br />Currently using this gentle, clean, vegan cleanser by To Do List as my second cleanse after Mizon:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDJR7S4<br /><br />I have a couple of double duty balm-to- oil cleansers that I like, and I would consider Mizon Cicaluronic  as a repurchase.",B08L3J4FB9,1608561747997,5.0

I have a facial cleanser by Hylunia I really like, and this has a similar feel to it. I would use this on my face while in the shower with no problems.

They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically, it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.<br /><br />The bars are thin, but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now, and it isn't just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.<br /><br />The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well. The scent is an intriguing mix of essential oils. Clove, Cinnamon, Oregano, Peppermint, Parsley, Eucalyptus and Rosemary essential oils Not overpowering. Really quite nice.<br /><br />It has been an odd, but unexpectedly pleasant product to use. The price is budget friendly. I find nothing bad about them or my experience so far.

There was no protective tape, tamper sticker, or cover, or product box... so I am not sure what this product has been through before arriving to me. Ew. I know products are sold by weight not volume, but the container really does look like it is missing a portion, as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity, with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense, so after settling, I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal, I am reticent to use in on my face, and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me, and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).<br /><br />Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive, the product smells good, and the ingredients are interesting; highly nourishing & repairing for the skin.

AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,"just like mousse or shaving cream, but is a soap for body","The bottle and texture is very much like a hair mousse or shaving cream, but is a wash for the body.  Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream.  The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents.  If you have ever used mousse, hair spray, various perfumes/body sprays, air fresheners, aerosol deodorants, or shaving cream,etc..  then you are already familiar with these ingredients. They are generally recognized as safe, and are used in small, diluted quantities in skin care. Fun fact, ""These ingredients are used in cosmetics and personal care products as a replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC propellants, some of which have been shown to have negative effects on the environment"".  I'm not a big fan of slathering my body with butane, propane, or isobutane, but I understand their use in this type of medium. So it's up to you to decide.<br /><br />This company does have non aerosol body wash available too..<br /><br />The resulting foamy wash comes out thick, it is creamy. Because it reminds me so much of a shaving cream, that it what I have been using it for. Then whatever is left over I use on rest of body. Is pleasant smelling enough to me but it isn't quite a pure aromatherapy experience for me. Clearly it uses a variety of essential oils- rosemary, orange, eucalyptus, peppermint, limonene. However, for whatever reason, it contains ""parfum (fragrance)"" as an added ingredient. As well as Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, another synthetic fragrance ingredient. Is there not enough naturally occurring scent from the use of essential oils? I think the added synthetic fragrance is redundant and takes away from the olfactory experience.<br /><br />As an actual wash, it is fine.<br />3 stars-- this is just a middle of the road rating.  I am not in love.  The experience is underwhelming. I am much too quickly going through the container. Aromatherapy experience is a little off  as I pick up on something other than essential oils.

I also prefer the cheapies only because I am not sure if the recipient will definitely use it, and the higher end masks tend to be more discerning in what it attends to.

Since this can be used near eyes, I may keep it only for that area. I have their serum and moisturizer with EGF & HA.  I would say from my experience with this line, is that this is more of a longer term use item.

So for me, I find that it is almost TOO light for my needs. Here is what I do like: I like that I can easily pair it with other products as it doesn't seem to pill or roll.  I would never use this at night as it is just too light for me, but it has been fine for use in my morning skin care routine- after a serum and before a moisturizing SPF. I don't feel like it works as my only moisturizer, but I DO think it is worth a try. The ingredients are fabulous.  While it doesn't feel like it is drying, it doesn't give me that dewy oomph that my preferred products can provide. Maybe I need to use it for a longer duration (sometimes that happens.. something I use for awhile doesnt seem to be doing anything but I keep using it to use it up, and at some point I notice a noted improvement).<br /><br />Despite it containing a lot of different nourishing oils, I would prefer it to feel and look a little oilier.

I highly recommend that it is paired with their Double Hydra Toner, especially if you like using hydrating toners using the 7 skins method (apply toner in layers until skin has soaked up as much as it can). Then follow with this, and the skin feels light, fresh, hydrated, supple, smooth, plump, and oh so happy. I find that I can use it day and/or night. I really have no preference.

I had to learn about ingredients and figure out what bothered me. But ultimately, I learned that it incorporating ingredients that help repair and maintain the skin barrier is what helps most of all. So ceramides, occlusives, Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF), Serine, copper, and several others.. that just help the skin significantly. Add in hydrating toners and consistent use of SPF, and the skin is looking good. Now, using harsh products can contribute to broken skin barrier, but often it is simply environmental or physical (too many exfoliating sessions, too harsh/physical scrubbing, too much sun/wind/vacillating temps). So I consider my skin semi sensitive because I am aware that I used to have really sensitive skin and now I seem to not to, but I still actively regard and address my skin in terms of maintaining skin barrier. THIS product has ingredients that help the skin barrier (NMF, Serine).<br /><br />I like it a lot, good stuff. Definitely recommend.",B088GWCVVJ,1600623351306,5.0
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,"like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash; zero eye irritation, easy to wash off","I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, ""made for USA but made in China"", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive ""natural, healthy"" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes ""4D silk fiber lashes"", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn't matter, but the box is super pretty.

Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.  OH yeh, this is good stuff for lips too. It isn't a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem.",B0859CYSTM,1593570937241,4.0
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,"this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow, absorbs well, hydrates, non greasy","Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says, ""medium"" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..<br /><br />This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen, using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays, converts them to heat, then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available, blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great, and it depends on what works best with  your skin.<br /><br />This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious, skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter, jojoba, oilve oil, and vitamin e. It comes out thin, and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round, and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often, sweating it off, etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized, I feel better about keeping it so simple.<br /><br />Again, I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you, then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool, fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast, at all. If your skin is real oily, then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin; seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy, and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive, non-acne Rosacea (redness, visible veins), I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year, and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else, it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot, and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck, then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try, and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).<br /><br />I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new, or think of anything else.",B0855L611L,1592427032313,5.0
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,"sharp, long plade, short handle, slices hair off easily","WOW!! These are good. They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2"". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5"". Many are 1"" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br /><br />I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won't lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br /><br />I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can't read anything else.<br /><br />Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don't over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn't grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.",B07R3BMYBG,1561224373116,4.0
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,"easy use, comfortable, could have longer nozzle","I use a larger plug in water flosser unit in my full bathroom (on upper level of house) which has a large capacity water reservoir. I typically take my time and use it at night before bed. However, I wanted a unit on my main floor bathroom for quick use during the day without having to go back upstairs, or for use if I am going to be gone all day and want to take it with me. Therefor I have been keen on getting a portable chargeable flosser. That, and my first floor bathroom is super tiny with nowhere to put a typical flossing unit nor anywhere to plug it in. This is perfect for me!<br /><br />Nice unit, right out of the box. It is attractive, feels comfortable in the hand, as is easy to get it going. While it comes with instructions, it is easy to figure out- very intuitive. USB cord is good length. The port that plugs into the unit has a pop-in cover (""anti-fouling rubber stopper""). It doesn't come attached, and I wish it did since I'd rather not have that area exposed to water. I sense that I will lose that cap soon enough, or just forget to use it. We'll see.<br /><br />The unit comes with four attachments, all for doing different jobs- so unless someone has a need for this unit and for an attachment for something different than what you need, I would say this is for solo use. Good sized water reservoir, too.<br /><br />Unlike my main unit, this one has a fairly straight nozzle in comparison. This makes it a challenge to get behind the rear most molars. If the nozzles were a little longer, with slightly more curve than it has, I would consider this a perfect product.",B07LCHCD6Q,1555785204360,4.0

You get 2 hydrating masks, one brightening, one clarifying, one anti-oxidant, one exfoliating and one renewal mask. These masks should really cover all you need which is great. They are free of toxins, so no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oil and castor oils. In addition they are biodegradable which is great.<br /><br />These are some nice masks that fit quite nicely and have a good amount of serum on them. I found that they actually have a nice pleasant fragrance that does differ from mask to mask based on the ingredients.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 20 to 30 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. The fit of the mask is very nice so no complaints there. Overall my face felt and looked great after I used it. Being able to address different issues with these different masks in nice, however I didn’t really see that much of an improvement with just one mask to be honest.

It is free of parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, gluten, formaldehyde and vegan friendly.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 15 to 20 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. My face was a bit sticky afterwards but that feeling did go away after about  minutes or so. The serum in the mask had a pleasant smell that I did like a lot. My face felt nicely moisturized when I used this mask and looked great. All in all this is a great mask I just wish it was not as expensive to be honest since it is not on the cheap sice to be used weekly.",B08BS3WDPJ,1611410267342,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Beautiful for every occasion,"In this pack for just over $7 you get 3 different colored hair clips and 2 each color, and then 7 hair ties. The hair clips are gold, silver and black and just beautiful. The hair ties are a plain black. These hair clips are a different, new design and  I wasn’t sure if they would work for my hair, but fear not they did. I have long, but thin hair, thin in density and thin in thickness and this hair clip worked just fine. I had no issues gathering just a section or the entire hair together. Even though the clips are flat in the front I had no issues at all working with these, they are actually quite easy to work with and fit quite comfortably in the hair. The size is big enough to fit my entire hair or just parts of it. They are cute and lovely and the price is not excessive, they are actually inexpensive if you ask me.",B08HMLXW65,1609093886864,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,"Doesn't lather, smells bad and doesn't clean","I have no idea how anyone can make a body wash with mango wrong, but they did and it is such a letdown. This one is one of the worst body washes I have ever use and it was such a disappointment, I don’t think I will even use up the rest of the bottle. I like that it comes in a convenient pump dispenser bottle but that and the price are about all I like about this product.<br /><br />The body wash smells horrible and I found it really doesn’t cleanses at all. I actually had a lipstick stain on the back of my hand that I wanted to get rid of and it could NOT get rid of it, like come one really? I don’t think getting rid of a lipstick is that difficult, any kind of soap or cream based product can do it but this body wash could not. I was not sure if I was even clean using this so I had to use something else on the important parts of the body just to make sure.<br /><br />Even at $5 this is not worth it since it doesn’t even smell great. This is a complete failure and I can’t recommend this at all, sorry I just can’t. At least you know it is super mild since it doesn’t even attack dirt.",B07YNDWRCB,1609081249231,2.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,"Good basic oils, many uses","You get 2 massive bottles of oil, one with sweet almond oil and the other with coconut oil. For each bottle they supply you with a pump dispenser which is great. It makes it so much easier to dispense the oil without making a mess to be honest. Both oils are claimed to be organic which is nice. This will run you $25 which in my eyes is a good deal.<br /><br />These oils can be used direct for skin care and as carrier oils, meaning you can add some essential oils to them to make your own custom oil blends. The oils themselves were pretty much fragrance-free which was a bit disappointing to me, but makes sense since these are often used as carrier oils. When you use this they are pretty lightweight and absorb quickly. I found they do leave the skin a bit greasy, but that is not a surprise since these are oils. That feeling does go away within about 15 minutes or so, so not too bad. All in all a good deal",B08LYT4Q2X,1608657012284,4.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Amazing facial oil,"Dr. Au Anti Aging Face Oil took me a little bit by surprise to be honest. This is a very nice retinol oil that has quickly become one of my favorites. It comes in a little dropper bottle. It has a very mild and very pleasant fragrance that I really like a lot. It lingers for a bit and I wish it would linger a lot longer than it does to be honest. I can’t figure out what it smells like but I really like the mix of it. This contains retinyl palmitate, related to retinol. Remember, whenever you use retinol you want to make sure to protect your skin from the sun since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. However retinol is very good for your skin.<br /><br />This face oil is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave your skin slightly oily but to me that is ok since I am using a face oil. I prefer to use this at night for two reasons, one because my face is a bit oily for a while when using it and also because retinol containing products do make your skin more sensitive to the sun. When I use this product my skin feels always super soft and smooth and looks nicely moisturized. There are little specs in it that look like gold and I am not sure if it is that or something else but when I use this facial oil my skin has this natural glow to it that I really like. This oil is fantastic and is quickly becoming one of my go to facial oils.",B07NPCT6L5,1606661625081,5.0

Next you will notice the incredible fragrance it has that I absolutely love, especially for facial products fragrances are very important to me and this one is fantastic.<br /><br />This cleanser is super gentle I found. After I am done my skin feels soft and smooth and not dried out at all. It actually feels almost like I moisturized it.

It does linger while you are in the shower but once you are all rinsed off, sadly it doesn’t last too long after that. The body wash does produce a decent lather but sadly it is not too luxurious.

First of it comes in a stunning squeeze tube that has a one of those interesting tips for a more concentrated spot application. This pretty silver tube will look great on any bathroom shelf really. It is meant for spot treatment for wrinkles and contains hyaluronic acid to help with that with lots of moisture to be added to the skin but other ingredients as well to help with all of that.<br /><br />This cream has a very nice but mild fragrance that I do like. The cream is very lightweight. That tip allows precise spot application to where you want and need to put it and allows small application of the product. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. I found that my skin is soft and smooth when I use this. It looks great, moisturized and just overall great. It is also not very expensive less than $25 so for me this one is a winner.",B07VDCD17L,1605106767486,5.0

But that changed rather quickly and I was impressed on how my face felt. It felt smooth and soft and just looked nicely moisturized. I for one really liked how this emulsion makes my face feel.

AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Underwhelmed - didn't work for me,"I have tried a few products by this line by Laloirelle. This Luminous Face oil comes in a dark glass dropper bottle like a lot of facial oils do. It is not cheap at almost $100 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br /><br />This particular one is filled with pomegranate oil, cacao oil infused with white peony root, marigold flower and lotus leaf. This particular blend is supposed to be brightening, soothing, regenerating, purifying and reduce the appearance of dullness. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br /><br />It provided some moisture but I didn’t really see a brightening effect to be honest, however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening. In the morning my skin felt nicely moisturized. Is this really worth the price? In my eyes not really since I have other brighteners that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this oil while not making my face greasy.",B08DXLRTSB,1602948560135,3.0

AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,"Nice, but not my favorite fragrance and a bit overpriced","This is an expensive facial moisturizer at $60. It comes in a little squeeze tube that has a pump dispenser opening, which are personally my favorite because I think these are just too neat. They claim  a visibly smoothing of wrinkles which I personally can’t say that I have seen happening.<br /><br />This moisturizer is light to medium weight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. It leaves some residue on the skin. That residue does go away within I would say 15 minutes or so. It has a decent fragrance that reminds me of essential oils, probably because it contains hemp and some other ingredients that would fall into that category that have that kind of fragrance. The scent leaves pretty quickly though.<br /><br />My skin feels nicely moisturized but I didn’t feel like it really did much for wrinkles to be honest. So I can recommend this for a moisturizer but not really for a wrinkle remedy. Downside, it is pretty expensive and I have moisturizers that are less expensive and also have a better fragrance.",B08C37KWRR,1601827045452,4.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,"Tiny bottles, not a fan of the fragrance, overpriced","I have always been a fan of Taya hair products. I found though that this duo is not one of my favorites. In this pack you get a shampoo and conditioner that are basically travel size for $14. They are a bit bigger than you would get at a hotel for example so you get quite a few applications out of them, but for $14 I find this to be rather expensive to be honest.<br /><br />The bottles are pretty cute and look nice. When I used the shampoo I have to say I was disappointed by the fragrance. Usually this line has a fantastic fragrance but this one just wasn’t it. It produced a decent lather and rinsed out with ease. The conditioner had a similar fragrance in line with the shampoo. It was nice and soft and I did leave it in my hair for about 3 minutes I would say. It was easy to rinse out and left no residue on my hair. My hair overall looked ok once it was dry and was pretty soft but nothing impressive that would warrant spending $14 on this. I am sorry I just wasn’t impressed with this set, especially since you can get the full sized ones for a similar price really.",B086XH7BWW,1601819843429,3.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Very rich and moisturizing - thick cream,"This is an interesting face mask. You get 5 masks for $20 so an ok price, maybe slightly more expensive than usual. You apply this mask to a clean face like you always do.  When you open the package you find 2 masks in it, they split the mask up into 2, the top and bottom.<br /><br />This mask is the first cream mask I have ever used. You will first notice the pleasant scent, the reason I ordered this in the first place. I have a serum by Abib that I love and has an incredible fragrance so I figured this one has to be a great product. This mask feels kind of weird on your face because of the cream. It reminds me a bit of nivea cream to be honest, fragrance wise and thickness / consistency wise. So after the 20 minutes are up you take it off and realize there is still a lot of cream on your face. So you gently massage it into your skin. My face felt a bit sticky from all that extra cream to be honest. After about 20 minutes or so that feeling did start to fade, that is just how long it took for all of it to absorb. This is one rich cream I tell you.  My face was nicely moisturized though and it definitely had a bit of a glow from all that cream to it to be honest.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice mask, but maybe a bit too rich for me. I think this would do wonders when your skin is super dry, like on a horrible winter day when you have been outside in the wind all day and your skin is almost peeling off from the cold dry wind. This would restore it back to health. Right now my skin is just a bit too healthy I would say and this one would just be so much better when my skin is in dire need.",B08575Y9V3,1601006929046,4.0

The moisturizer is pretty much fragrance free, it maybe has a hint of a fragrance that is pleasant but very subtle.<br /><br />The moisturizer itself is very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. You can instantly notice the difference between where you put it and where you didn’t. It mattifies the skin nicely and really neutralizes the oils in your skin nicely. I was rather impressed by that to be honest. My skin looked great, nice and matte but still moisturized.

When you use this the skin feels moisturized afterwards without having used a moisturizer. But the skin does not feel greasy or oily which is great since I am not a fan of that feeling.  You also don’t need to use a lot of this in order to get the benefits of the product. And yes I admit, I actually like using this on myself.

That fragrance lingers for quite some time. It works very well protecting from sweat and odor. I was pleasantly surprised how well it actually worked.

I like that this bottle has a pump dispenser which makes it just so much easier to dispense the shampoo in the shower.<br /><br />The shampoo has a very pleasant scent that I like a lot. It produces only a medium lather but it still works quite well to clean your hair. I personally prefer a nice rich lather with my shampoos. It rinses out very easily and leaves you with squeaky clean hair. My hair looked good when I used this and I have no complaints there.

The mister on it is actually very nice and pretty fine allowing you to distribute the product very nicely onto your hair, and therefore you don't need that much of it. It smells absolutely fantastic and does exactly what it promises. I have absolutely not tangles in my hair when I use this.<br /><br />My hair is nice and soft and looks just great. This is a great product to you use for your hair. When dry my hair is still very manageable and looks great. I really like this a lot and what it does to my hair.",B07THLR7RR,1598742055944,5.0

It is completely scentless which is disappointing but will work well for people sensitive to scents.<br /><br />They claim that it will not leave you with a greasy after feel, well I am not sure what they are talking about. It absorbs quickly but I definitely had a greasy residue on my skin and that stuck with me. I would recommend using this in the evenings only because of this. You wouldn't want to wear a face mask with this greasy feel on your face. You already sweat a lot in those masks and this would make you feel even worse in them. As an overnight moisturizing treatment this does work well though.<br /><br />But would I repurchase at this price?

When you do that you will notice that fantastic fragrance this has which is great since you will have this on your face for 15 to 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />During that time it will dry out and harden. Once the time is up rinse it warm water. I prefer to do these masks before I go into the shower so I can just rinse them when I am in the shower, so much easier and less of a mess if you ask me.<br /><br />Once you are done you will notice that your skin eels actually nice and soft. A lot of these clay masks tend to dry up your skin but I was impressed that this one did not. It actually felt almost moisturized but I still followed it up with a nice moisturizer right after I was done like I always do.<br /><br />I have to say this clay mask is great. It smells fantastic, is nice and gentle and does not dry you out.

AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,"Love it, oriental scent that is very similar to LouLou","This is a very nice perfume. It is not too expensive since it is less than $40 which is great. When I got it and sprayed it on I had instant flashbacks of another perfume that I really like. It is very reminiscent of LouLou and when I looked up the fragrance profile for both there is a lot of overlap of the similar top, heart and base notes.<br /><br />I found that this one in comparison is a bit less heavy though and not as overpowering. It has a very oriental kind of scent though and I do really like it, ask LouLou, since it is standing right next to it on my perfume shelf. I figured that was the proper space for it. This one does have a hint of lightness though that LouLou does not. It does last quite a bit and does not just disappear after a few hours which is nice.<br /><br />The bottle is very cute and oh so Shakira in my eyes. It is perfect for teens if you ask me but I have no problem putting that on my shelf either. So to keep the comparison going, at the same volume it is cheaper than LouLou but if you get the 2.7 Fl Oz you pay the same price as you would for the 1.7 Fl Oz for LouLou so you could get a better deal but even though they are similar there are just different enough that I can smell the difference if I do a blind test.",B0BTJ6SYKB,1596026312471,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,"Overpriced, doesn't smell like argan oil and to me just about average",This Argan oil is just above around in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes. I know Argan oil is not cheap but this does seem a bit overpriced. I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct. It does feel nice on your skin and absorbs pretty quickly but does leave a slight oily feel behind for a short time and that does disappear. At that point my skin felt nice but there are other products I have that make my skin feel a lot better to be honest and give it an amazing smell to boot.

It feels very nice on the face and cleanses gently away anything from your face.

AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,"Interesting concept, way overpriced and fell short in my eyes","This is an interesting concept. You get 15 bubble pads in this container. Each pad is dry though when you get them. You can actually slip your fingers into the pad which makes it easier to use these pads. With these pads you can exfoliate so that is in theory nice but I found in execution it just didn't work as well. The pads didn't have a pleasant scent, well they were actually rather scentless so to me that was rather boring.<br /><br />So when you use them you wet the pads and then clean your face with them. I found that there wasn't as many bubbles as I would have expected from a ""bubble pad"" so that to me was disappointing. They overall cleaned my face ok and I found they didn't dry out my face too much. All in all these worked ok but I wasn't too impressed. You can get a bottle of a nice cleanser for the same price or maybe more but that will last you a lot more than just 15 applications! so to me this is way overpriced and a bit of a waste to be honest.",B0851C4YPC,1594395709227,2.0

Even though I am not a fan of skin products coming in jars, this jar is just plain beautiful.

It contains collagen and hyaluronic acid which are fantastic ingredients for your skin.<br /><br />The cream is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. It leaves no residue behind, just soft and smooth skin that looks and feels great. You don't need a lot of this moisturizers so this jar should last you a good while.

One word of caution, please keep in mind when you use products containing retinol to use sun blocker and to apply them in the evening since these can make your skin sensitive to sun light.<br /><br />This serum comes in a stunning little plastic squeeze tube looking like upside down pump dispenser. It has a pleasant and mild scent that I really like.<br /><br />The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. There is some residue for a brief while but that goes away pretty quickly. It leaves you with nice soft skin that is smooth and feels great. All in all I really do like this even though it is a bit more on the expensive side for what you get.

AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,A sticky mess with an ashen yellowish color that smells funky but at least you are protected,"I really wanted to like this face moisturizer since I prefer using a tinted moisturizer over a foundation every day and this one on top of it also has an SPF 31 to protect your face from the sun. So to me that would be a win win situation.<br /><br />It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works very well. Unfortunately that is where the positive really stops in my eyes. The moisturizer is not too thick and almost runny but it isn't. It is very tinted so it kept up on that promise. I did NOT like the smell of it at all and that scent actually does linger while you apply it and some time after so that was definitely a bit no no in my eyes.<br /><br />The applying of the moisturizer was not very pleasant since it was very sticky in my eyes. Distributing it evenly on my face took some actual work and I just didn't like that. IT was not like most moisturizers that just get nicely soaked up by your skin but because of its sticky consistency, which actually reminded me of a foundation, it took a bit. My skin also didn't feel great afterwards and I almost felt like I needed to set it with a setting powder like you would with a foundation. The color of it was also a bit off, some ashen yellowish brown that I found was not very flattering but thankfully it did not add a lot of color to my skin but actually blended into my skin after a little bit and you hardly noticed you added a tinted moisturizer.<br /><br />At least while I was out and about my face was protected from the sun and I did not get sun burnt, so that was the other upside of this moisturizer. But all in all I did not care for the scent of it, the stickiness during application and that it left behind and how it really made my skin look. To me this is more a fail than anything else really.",B0855L611L,1592263193148,2.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Leaves your skin a bit sticky and not huge on the scent but works,"The Iryasa Face Cream comes in a little jar, which is not my favorite container since you obviously dip into it all the time. So I tend to wash my hands before I do that so I don't introduce dirt and such into it because that can shorten the life span of these products.<br /><br />The cream itself is actually a little heavy which was surprising since it looked light and airy. It has some nice natural ingredients in it which is great. I wasn't too crazy about the smell of it though but that is because it used Geranium essential oil, which is probably one of my least favorite but I was hoping that the lemon would help cover it but it still powered through a lot.<br /><br />The cream absorbs fairly quickly into your skin and but leaves a sticky residue on your skin that doesn't seem to fade for quite some time. Thankfully by using this at night you won't know since you add this last thing before you go to bed and then just fall asleep. It does add moisture to your skin so in the morning your skin does feel pretty nice.",B07W397QG4,1592146223099,4.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Perfect to dress up longer hair,"This is a nice set of scrunchies. You get quite a variety of different scrunchies in this. You get some simple ring scrunchies I guess they call them that are my personal favorite, mostly because the colors are absolutely amazing in this trio. Then you get a trio of bunny ear style scrunchies that is also very cute and decorative and lastly a trio of scarf scrunchies that is very decorative as well.<br /><br />In addition you get 7 hair pins to dress up your hair that are very cute. I still have to learn how to use this the right way and make them work in my hair. I have finer hair so these tend to slide out but I know there is a trick to make them stay in place. This is definitely a cute set that is worth getting to dress up your hair.",B07VQR3W3Z,1586525869655,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Impressively easy to use and looks great,"This kit is fantastic. It comes with everything you need to get your nails done with a gel manicure. It has step by step instructions that are easy to follow and you end up with great looking nails. It actually doesn't take too long either since you can cure 4 nails at a time in the UV lamp except the thumps. So far I have only used the gray and really like that color a lot.<br /><br />Now what I really wish is that they have an adjunt kit where you can order more colors to go with the kit to mix it up some. Just having pink and gray is not enough in my eyes and let's face it having more options would be great where you could pick and choose other colors.<br /><br />I love the fact that you can just peel off the nail polish when you are done instead of having to use harsh chemicals to remove it. I always hated that part and that was one reason why I don't often use nail polish, that and the fact that regular nail polish is pretty damaging to your nails. Gel nail polish is actually pretty gentle to your nails and protecting at that plus it looks great.<br /><br />No complaints here, very happy with how long it took and the end results.",B0813ZQG3T,1585140652164,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Serum leaves your face pretty tacky but is scentless for those looking for one,"This Vitamin Brightening Ampoule by BE PLAIN is just ok in my eyes. It is pretty much scentless so that is boring but it does come in a beautiful frosted little dropper bottle. The serum is however just ok.<br /><br />The serum is fairly lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. The downside with it however is it leaves your skin tacky and that feeling fades but never really fully goes away. There is always a bit of that tacky residue on your skin. I did not notice any significant brightening effects either so it did not come through on that promise either.<br /><br />All in all this is just ok to be honest. I didn't really like how my face felt and it didn't really brighten it either. It does have some ingredients that are good for my face so at least it does some good things for my face even if I don't necessarily like how it feels when it is on, but you can always put another moisturizer on.",B083TLNBJJ,1584971784304,3.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Haev seen some improvement with eyelashes and eyebrows,"This is a nice, inexpensive conditioner for your eyelashes and eyebrows. It is very gentle and you can comfortable use it around the eyes. I have had no negative reactions not even teary eyes at any time. This product is very easy to use which is good. So far I noticed a mild increase in regards to eye lashes and my eye brows do look a little fuller. Considering the price point of this product I think it is worth the investment to see if it works for you as well.",B07PCSRSND,1584828792482,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Incredible sheet mask that makes your face really happy,"This is a very nice sheet face mask. It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face. I like the fact that it comes in two pieces so you really can make it fit perfectly to your face. The one pieces are just one fits all kind of masks and lets face it, not all faces are the same scie or shape and therefore they just don't all fit. With this one you have a lot of nice wriggle room which is great.<br /><br />It is very easy to put on. Once it is on you let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes (btw, if you go longer you get more of the goodies). So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read. I did notice that it is fairly heavy though but it amazingly did not slip on me but I was afraid that it may.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses and for once not overpowering of it. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of roses but this one was pleasant since it was not this cloying smell of it. This is a collagen mask and when you remove it you can tell how soft your face is. I really liked this mask but it is on the more expensive side. You get 4 masks in the box for $25, so each is about $6, so that is a bit on the higher end of sheet masks but they are very nice.",B07J1LYVHC,1584453999779,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Work great for what they are meant for,"In today's age when you are restricted with how much liquids you can bring along on your travels on an airplane, it makes sense to fill these little refillable atomizer bottles with your favorite perfume to bring along so you can have them in your carry on luggage. Some times you don't even have a checked in luggage so this is important.<br /><br />I like that in this pack you get 5 different ones. You can dedicate each one to a different perfume so you can bring different ones on your travel. These work very well and you can bring enough on your travels for at least a week plus. They are easy to fill and use and work very well. These are on the cheaper side but for what they are intended these work perfectly well.",B015A5DGG4,1583594267319,4.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Very nice mascara but a little bit overpriced,"This is a very nice mascara. It does come however in a cheaper looking container I think, at least to me the cartoonish container looks cheaper. I didn't think it really added that much volume to my lashes as much as it actually lengthened them which is fine. It added a good amount of length to be honest and did add a little bit of volume though. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness but then you would get that spidery look that I do not care for.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />This is a nice mascara and it will cost you $18. I have some others that perform similarly that are cheaper than this one though so it is a bit overpriced in my eyes.",B07RM722DH,1583326586217,4.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Help those poor abused hands,"This is a very nice hand care bundle for very hands on people. First you get a very nice hand cleaner that contains activated charcoal. This detoxes and cleans very nicely of the toughest dirt, eliminating strong odor but doesn't damage your hands like some strong cleaners might do.<br /><br />Next you get a moisturizing and healing cream. This is great for those who have done some damage to their hands in some physical hand jobs where they hand up with dry and cracked hands. This gives back some moisture and heals those hands.<br /><br />Last but not least is a nice protect and moisturizer. This adds a nice barrier to your hands but also adds much needed hydration to much abused hands that are dry, cracked and scaly. When you have this on your hands it is much easy to wash and wipe away stubborn dirt.<br /><br />This is a nice little set that can also be gifted, especially for people who work with their hands like mechanics or wood workers but many others. This works really well and will help restore some of those much abused hands.",B082VKPJV5,1583068556518,4.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,"I don't like menthol, but if you do this is not bad","I really wanted to like this but I am just not a fan. It has a very strong menthol scent to it that I just am not big on. I am very sensitive to menthol smells and can't stand it. This one is very strong and overpowering.<br /><br />It does have a refreshing feel to it but the smell of menthol just overpowers everything. My skin was soft when I used it and did not dry out so that is great. So for those who like menthol this is great, but for me this just doesn't work.",B0844X21MJ,1583003727078,3.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Beautifully scent duo that performs nicely,"This is now the third product from Taya I have tried out, and I have to say this line does not dissappoint. This is probably the most fancy dispenser I have had to date and the most fancy looking bottle. The shampoo is this super creamy, beautiful creamy shampoo. It does not produce a massive lather but to cleanse your hair that is not necessary. You will also notice the incredible smell it has. The conditioner smells the same. I have a body spray that it reminds me off and it is just incredible.<br /><br />This set is a bit on the more expensive side but my hair does look, feel and smell amazing when I use it, so I use this on my splurge and pamper days. They do make some claims for anti breakage and some ingredients that supposedly help with that. I can't really confirm those claims but I do really like this set a lot. It also comes in this unique bottle with an interesting dispensing mechanism and unlike some I had no issues with it whatsoever.",B07VGBBNTH,1582257771798,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Sturdy and easy to assemble,"This is a nice makeup holder with some ""bling"". Apparently I have accumulated too many products over the last few months and was in need of additional storage. This one is similar to another one I have. Just like with other ones with a lazy Susan the shelves are adjustable which is great since you have products of different size. On the top it has different sections so you can put some items like small bottles, eye liners, brushes, mascara and so on in there to keep those organized as well, which my other two lazy Susan organizers do not have, so this is kind of neat in my eyes. All my organizers are just a tad different so I keep them for different purposes, this one is great for lotions, dropper bottles and mascaras and such. It is very sturdy and a great addition to keep my things organized.",B07X8W7GJZ,1581724386204,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Fantastic lip balm,"This set of lip balm is very nice. It applies easily and leaves your lips feeling nice and soft without feeling greasy or tacky. They taste of tangerine which is great. I admit, for lip balms I want one that has a good flavor at this point and this one delivers 100%. It is packed with great for your lips ingredients such as hemp seed oil, Vitamin E and olive oil and no, it does not taste like olive oil. It is cruelty free which is another bonus in my eyes.<br /><br />It was a bit tricky to open though but once you get it it is actually a neat design, instead of twisting it on the bottom you twist it right by the bottom of the cap.",B07Z3NRMBS,1581121008897,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Very nice face serum by Merlot,"This is the third product I have tried by Merlot and I also like this one, so 2 out of 3 is not bad. This serum is packed with peptides, resveratrol and grape seed extract.<br /><br />You don't need a lot of this and what you apply quickly absorbs into your skin. It smells great and smells of grapes, which is actually a rare scent in beauty products and nice for a change. My skin felt and looked great when I used this serum. The price is also very reasonable so I for one can recommend this. I am also a fan of the pump dispenser, it is clean and easy to work with and keeps the rest of the product clean as well.",B07WNBZQGT,1581120030923,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Perfectly moisturized skin that smells heavenly of coconut,"Now this is a body lotion I can only recommend. It is in very classy blue bottle and packed with some very good ingredients like almond oil, Vitamin C, E and K, and Kale, and you will feel that.<br /><br />First when you use it, you will notice this heavenly smell of coconut! I love coconut so when a lotion smells of coconut and makes me smell of it, well I am 100% in favor of it. But it gets better. Once you use this on your skin, it leaves you with super soft, beautiful looking skin that smells of coconut. You don't need a lot of this lotion and it quickly and fully absorbs into your skin.<br /><br />This for me is a perfect body lotion.",B07SW7D6ZR,1581119592888,5.0
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,Just ok in my book,"This goat milk cleanser is very gentle. It almost felt like a lotion when I used it. So the description that it does NOT lather is 100% accurate. I was a bit confused by that to be honest so yes read the description. It works very well that is true. It was almost completely without scent, it may have had some very mild scent but I couldn't describe what it smelled like.<br /><br />To me it was weird to wash your face with something that felt more like a lotion than anything else. So this only gets an ok since it wasn't outstanding in any category really. I had no negative reactions to it and it is super gentle but that is about it.",B07NPWK167,1579807307028,3.0

AGTW6ZGPUAORQ7X6CNBP6PJW7OTA,Cool and Moisturizing,"This is definitely a ""cooling"" body wash. It makes my skin tingle and would be excellent in the summer months when you need to bring your body temperature down. The scent is like menthol-eucalyptus, but a bit sweeter. The lather is very thick and smooth, and it rinses away leaving my skin feeling cool and moisturized. The only reason for the 4-star rating is the price. $15 is a bit much for 6 ounces of product.",B0844X21MJ,1582937012377,4.0
AGTW6ZGPUAORQ7X6CNBP6PJW7OTA,A Great Combination,"I love the combination of this shampoo and conditioner. Both smell like sweet coconut.<br />The shampoo has a thick and luxurious lather and definitely feels like it adds volume to my hair.<br />The conditioner is thick, but light, a bit like a body butter. It softens my hair and leaves it extremely soft and silky.<br />The only reason I can't give these products five stars is because I think they're a bit overpriced. Yes, they create great results, but so do a lot of comparable brands that are less than half the price.",B07VGBBNTH,1580956572534,4.0

It has longer and shorter hard bristles along the sides. I'm by no means a beginner with mascara, but for some reason I've poked my eye with this mascara applicator a couple of times already.

AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,"Used For Watercolors, It Works Well For Small Details","I have a set of Kolinsky sable brushes which moths got at a while ago and I have been wanting to replace them.  This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.  I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This works for what I want it for in doing watercolors.  It is not quite as nice as the Kolinsky Sable brushes I lost, but it is a nice fill in for now.  I would buy it again.",B07ZJX5MNJ,1593455018534,5.0
AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,"Seems To Work, But I Think Mine Might Be Going Rancid","I am all about natural skin care.  When I read about this product and the lovely smell it had, I was very excited to try it.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This cream is yellow in color- very pale yellow.  It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.  It is potentially really nice cream though.  If you get a fresh one, I imagine it is really nice.  Just make sure to use it up and if you live in a hot climate, keep it in the refrigerator or air conditioning.",B07W397QG4,1592227566376,4.0
AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,Simple Scent Free Skin Care Absorbs Easily Does It Do What It Says?,"I am always on the lookout for really nice simple skin care.  Let's take a look at this ampule.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a clear solution that comes out with an eye dropper.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />The idea is that you use a toner on your CLEAN face, apply this to the face and neck and chest, and then follow up with a moisturizer.<br /><br />WHAT DOES IT PROMISE TO DO?<br />This promises to lighted dark spots, and add firmness, glow, and hydration.<br /><br />DOES IT DO WHAT IT SAYS?<br />I used this with another Korean toner which is pretty simple, and also the BE PLAIN Aqua moisturizer.  When used, this did not seem to moisturize that much on its own, and for brightness and glow, I would say not over WOW factor after using for a month.<br /><br />DID SKIN LOOK FIRMER?<br />I guess you could say my skin looked a bit firmer, but nothing so dramatic that people said, ""WOW, WHAT ARE YOU USING ON YOUR FACE?""<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a scent free, easy to use serum for the face.  It works well with moisturizer, is simple, scent free, and gives a moderate amount of what it says it will do.  It is not remarkable, but it is not terrible either.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is decent, but not my favorite product at this point.",B083TLNBJJ,1587674511800,4.0
AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,FINALLY Truly Nice Toenail Clippers & Bonuses,"I don't know about you, but our household goes through nail clippers fast.  Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.",B07J3GH1W1,1545168972059,5.0

AG73BVBKUOH22USSFJA5ZWL7AKXA,"When you use them, follow directions","This mask is a little bit different from others, Many are like paper. This one is a bit heavier and you will want to probably lay down while you have this on so that it doesn't slip. Follow the Directions: STEP 1. Remove the film<br />Clear up the skin with toner after cleansing, take the mask pack and remove the white film on one side. STEP 2. Attach the mask pack.  Attach the upper half with your eyes at the center and the lower half with your mouth at the center. Tip! It is better to attach the lower part first. STEP 3. Absorption. Remove the mask after 30 minutes and absorb the essence remaining on the skin by lightly tapping it with your fingers. The final on this mask is that it feels good, it does a good job and I am glad there are 3 more I can use before I have to buy more",B07J1LYVHC,1580159586262,4.0

I do know I will not use them on any area other than my eyebrows. Some women will probably use them on their upper lip and chin area but not me. I have always felt like if you shave some areas, more hair grows back in. This may be a myth. But my daughter shaved her belly and her arms and she has hair growth that is darker than what she had previously.

AE3KLVXGZPANXE5XLXYKHTVAZ3FQ,Pretty decent product but do your research,"Overall, this product isn’t horrible compared to others on the market. It is paraben-free, sulfate-free, EU Allergen free and uses minimal ingredients however it also contains alcohol, silicone and is not safe for fungal acne.  After running this product through a cosmetic ingredient safety checker, it scored an 88% one the EWG Health Rating.  Most popular, name-brand face lotions are around 65%-80% on the EWG Health Rating. I use the EWG (Environment Working Group) as a reference when checking products and try to stay away from the alarmist side. Only 8% of this product is considered “moderate risk” mainly polyarylamide, Fragrance (unnecessary additive; possible allergy) , alcohol denat. (Bad for dry skin, bad for sensitive skin, potentially block pores) and BHT (also found in edibles, rubber products and is banned in UK and EU due to limited research showing BHT is linked to cancer). This product is good for brightening, anti-aging and promotes wound healing.  It also contains steric acid which can potentially block pores.<br /><br />Keep in mind, everyone’s skin is different and what effects one person may not effect another. Learn your skin and what products work best for you. Personally, I would stay away from this product if you have very dry skin and/or sensitive skin. I have “normal” skin (no sensitivities, not overly dry or oily, limited acne, no allergies) and didn’t have any issues with this product so far. It has a light scent that isn’t overpowering but completely unnecessary (I HATE fragrance in beauty products; stick with essential oils). It absorbed nicely and didn’t leave my face feeling oily. I am giving this product 4 stars as of February 21, 2021 due to the minimal ingredients and will update this review once a larger amount of time has passed to fully understand how to works with my skin.",B01N7A5AGF,1613917893005,4.0

AETWQ4GYGV4QRMTMWGBIDVASBKHA,Great clay facial mask,"I have very sensitive dry skin, So I was worried that this would over dry and irritate my skin. First of all, it smells amazing. It smells very natural, like greenery and botanicals. This mask has ever so slightly some grit to it. It isn't the scrubbiest of exfoliating masks. The clay doesn't over dry your skin. I do not feel like my skin is tight feeling after washing my face. Overall, it feels very luxurious and relaxing. Great weekly skin treat to unwind at home.

This cream is soothing and leaves a lot of moisturize but not a lot of goop.

AHWCZ47A7FIYEJ7KEJG3BO3F5YXQ,Nice grooming set,"My husband used this kit and took, when asked to do a bit of a review on it for me, took it very seriously. The price isn't cheap so he wanted to make sure to really look at everything as he used it. Here is what he had to say:<br /><br />""You have a pack of accessories here so I thought I would run through them in turn to tell you what you are getting and my impression of it<br /><br />Shampoo and body wash.<br />Okay, I ran through this way too quick and used all of it. It's good. It's really good and I couldn't really get enough of it. So that's a plus and a negative in that there isn't really a lot of it to begin with.<br /><br />Face wash.<br />I love to get In there and give my face a right good scrubbing. This helps. The wash is thick and gel like with the exfoliating, and it does feel like you have given your face a good scrub after use. You do feel cleaner after use.<br /><br />Shave cream<br />I'm not one for using cream very often. I prefer basic foam from a can. But wow. This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br /><br />Moisture cream<br />This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br />What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br /><br />For the most part then I really like this set. It comes in a handy pouch you can use long after the accessories are empty. However, that won't take too long because the bottles are very small. It's something for people who aren't concerned about the cost. It's very expensive. Is it worth the cost for me? Not really. Not in terms of either quality or quantity but if the price was lower I would be recommending to everyone.""<br /><br />There you go guys and gals. That's what he thought about the set. He's still talking about it so he did like it, just thought it was a bit much.",B07JGD2T2J,1601232869958,4.0
AHWCZ47A7FIYEJ7KEJG3BO3F5YXQ,Great brushes!,"This is a very good set of brushes and combs, especially for the price. They work great. You get four things in this set. You'll receive a paddle brush, a rectangle comb, a detangler hair brush, and a tail comb. I don't really use the combs as much as the brushes but did give them a bit of a testing so I could type a review. I absolutely love all of these brushes and combs. They are sturdy and work very well. When used for what they are supposed to be used for specifically I thought they all held up well and did their jobs. They detangled perfectly and when used for styling they were easy to hold on to, didn't get in the way at all, and worked the hair into it's style nicely.<br />I would recommend these if you are looking for a good set of hair brushes and combs that won't cost you much. These are terrific for that!",B082MDFNZM,1586713851194,5.0

The only thing is that after a little while they did begin to dig in bit where they rest at the ends. Not too much but enough to make it uncomfortable after a long period of time.

AHWCZ47A7FIYEJ7KEJG3BO3F5YXQ,Works great,"This shampoo and conditioner leaves hair feeling clean, soft, and manageable after the first use. It smells nice, too, which is also a plus!<br />My hair is not that of a teen or even young adult anymore so it's been through a lot. When looking for shampoo and conditioning products I tend to look closer at those that claim to make hair stronger, reduce breakage, and things with words like ""restore"" and ""fortify"". These hit the mark so I decided to give them a shot.<br />I've been using them about three weeks and I think that they are definitely doing my hair some good. It looks healthy and feels very soft. The conditioner does a good job with tangles and knots. I do sometimes still use a leave in conditioner or separate type of moisture just because it's winter my hair is increasingly dry on any given day depending. I can't tell for sure about the breakage but it does seem stronger. I suppose in many ways they go hand in hand. It has more pull to it so it's not snapping and breaking as much.<br />I like this. A little goes a long way as well which is nice.",B07VGBBNTH,1582817808950,5.0
AHWCZ47A7FIYEJ7KEJG3BO3F5YXQ,These work very well,"This mask is very nice. I have never used a mask like this one before. It's heavier than the usual thin almost paper or gel like masks that a lot of them seem to be. This one definitely has a bit more to it. It's also a two piece mask which is great in some ways because sometimes I looks like a one person comedy routine trying to get the masks on right while they flip and flop all over.<br />With this mask you put the bottom part then the top by your eyes, it makes it a lot easier. Then you leave it on for at least 20 minutes ( though it says to leave it on for 30 so I did that). When you take it off you gently pat the left over into your skin.<br />It leaves your skin feeling so soft and really well moisturized. I feel like it did a very nice job with firming up the skin as well. I have only used two of these so far, one a week over two weeks, and have really liked the way my skin looked and felt after each use. I would recommend giving these a try if you can. Perhaps in summer as they have a nice cooling feel to them that I bet would feel great in the summer heat!",B07J1LYVHC,1582127825944,4.0
AF4P6A3SEKS2HCISWAKFZVIFM7NQ,Great for Travel,"As most have said here – these are great for travel, especially when you can’t find soap around but have water. Though I wouldn’t carry a bar of soap, I have used “travel” size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway …<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don’t intend to travel where I won’t have soap. So, I’m using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me – it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don’t really smell a “scent”, hands wash clean. They don’t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn’t say these go years – if you’re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup – they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they’re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That’s just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.",B09473GGM4,1626746723600,3.0

I love the idea of the individually gift boxed tubes, the cap is wonderful (huge and easy to use), the product is generously sized.<br /><br />The problem is that this stuff is runny, doesn’t absorb that well on me, and the “scent” that is there – it isn’t that great.<br /><br />For $15 before tax, that is roughly $3.75 a tube, and while they’re smaller – I’d honestly stick with Bath & Body Works.<br /><br />This isn’t something I’d get again and I wouldn’t recommend it.

I had to SMASH it with my arm to get it to MOVE.<br /><br />The scent? If you’re looking for Bath & Body Works type of Cherry Blossom, you’re not going to get it.<br /><br />Once you get it out, and can take the scent – after it is applied, it is a soft, moisturizing and no slip scrub.<br /><br />This isn’t something I’d get again or recommend.",B07PZ8JNWJ,1607946519665,2.0

A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.<br /><br />Getting my nails done is not just a relaxing experience, but it is also an expressive/creative one.<br /><br />Seeing this colorful and glittery set – I had to get it.<br /><br />I don’t know about others’ experiences – mine did not come with a brush or applicator for the little “gel pots”. I remembered what my nail techs used to use – small make-up brushes – and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect. I chose the purple glitter gel and after a few awkward moments – I got a pretty decent manicure. More of the black showed through, there were moments when the purple glitter reflected, but it wasn’t what I thought.<br /><br />I haven’t tried the other colors. But, this is fairly decent and easy to use. Not my favorite as there are other brands out there that are even easier to use.<br /><br />Overall, I’m not too unhappy with it.

The light design is nice but too much for me when I’m sleeping. You have to turn off the whole thing to turn the lights off. You can turn on the diffuser without lights but once on I can only get them off by turning off the diffuser. It lasts almost through the night maybe 6 hours? I find taking off the ceramic cover easier than covers of other diffusers. I use this for just my bedroom so it is perfect.

I have to file off the layers of top coat, which can take a while if I don’t have a good file. I prefer a glass file for actually shaping my nails, but they’re not good for removing layers of polish.<br /><br />Using one of these files, I had the top coat filed off all my nails in less than ten minutes. The 100 grit side is perfect. I actually asked a nail tech friend what I should use, and she told me 100 grit.<br /><br />The files come in a zipper seal plastic bag that can be used to store them.<br /><br />The edges of the files aren’t sharp. I’m talking about the edges that touch your skin; sometimes these can be sharp, especially on pro files, and need to be seasoned to prevent cuts.

AFVV7CLXY43P3Z3F7SROBZATZVSQ,Looks cool and works well,"The look of the Lassie hair dryer is what caught my eye first. It just looks cool! I have the PinkGray color. The gray is a medium shade with a smooth finish that won’t pick up hairs and dust. The pink is a metallic magenta that really pops.<br /><br />The speed controls are on the handle. The slide button doesn’t move easily, so there’s not a big chance of accidentally changing the speed/temperature without meaning to. On the back of the handle is the option for either cool or hot temperature.<br /><br />The hair dryer doesn’t dry my hair any faster than any other hair dryer I’ve used. But I like that I can set the temperature to cool to lessen damage and not have to hold in a cool shot button.<br /><br />The hair dryer isn’t as lightweight as some plastic models I’ve used, but it’s weighted pretty well. The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place. I like it -- there’s less chance of them popping off while I use the hair dryer.<br /><br />The bottom of the hair dryer says the rated power is 1800 watt, which is contrary to the description which says it is 2000 watt.",B082VYX7G8,1596384370769,4.0
AFVV7CLXY43P3Z3F7SROBZATZVSQ,Aloe Vera Gel,"This Aloe Vera Gel by Sdara Skincare takes a few minutes to fully absorb into my skin. I worried it would leave behind a sticky feeling, since I could feel it on my arm the whole time it took to dry. But once the gel finally absorbed, I couldn’t feel any residue left behind. I didn’t notice much of any scent either, which is another positive for me.<br /><br />The gel is clear; the plastic bottle is amber colored to help keep light out. I wish the bottle had a flip top or squeeze lid instead of a screw off cap.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is what gives me pause. I’m not sure why sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) would need to be added to the organic aloe leaf juice. The product description mentions “we perfected our serum by enriching with Vitamin E, & Citric Acid for improved nutrient absorption.” I don’t see Vitamin E listed in the ingredients.<br /><br />I will probably end up using this aloe vera gel to make hand sanitizer. The gel is thick, so it should be good for that use.",B08879N2W3,1594438114269,3.0

This gel absorbed into my skin after about a minute, without leaving behind a sticky or tacky feeling. I’ve used some aloe vera gels that have left me a sticky mess, but not this one. So I like the quick absorption.<br /><br />The gel does have a slight scent to it. It’s a fresh-smelling scent that sticks around for a while.<br /><br />This Aloe Vera gel would also be great for homemade hand sanitizer.<br /><br />This gel is manufactured in China.",B086VYKNDF,1594396177794,4.0

It lathers well and rinses clean without leaving behind a residue.<br /><br />I really like the smell of the body wash. It’s a strong, crisp scent that really does wake you up. My nose tingled the first time I smelled it. The scent is hard to describe.

These products might seem dude oriented, but they work for anyone.<br /><br />Superior Hand Cleaner with Activated Charcoal (individually 4/5 stars):<br />--Works great to remove grease and odors. I like the pumice in the cleanser, as it gives me a real clean, scrubby feeling.<br /><br />Superior Barrier Skin Cream (individually 4/5 stars):<br />--Actually does help prevent grease or oil from staining my hands. Also helps keep my fingernails from becoming a dirt mess when I weed without gloves. But doesn’t provide much of a moisturizing effect.<br /><br />Superior Healing Hand Cream (individually 3/5 stars):<br />--Truly unscented hand lotion.

This lotion is made in Canada.<br /><br />The lotion absorbed quickly into my skin, but did leave behind a slightly tacky feel for about 5 minutes after application.<br /><br />It’s currently the middle of winter where I am, so I was able to see just how moisturizing the lotion is for me when I already had dry skin. The lotion has a medium-weight consistency and gets the job done for about half the day.<br /><br />What I don’t like about this lotion is the scent. The scent is subtle, sort of like vanilla coconut, and it’s fine at first. But the scent lingers for several hours, and after that time, I’ve had enough of it.",B07SW7D6ZR,1583195563348,3.0

These worked well in my thick hair, although the satin ones do loosen up a bit but only because the material is slippery.  You can wear all day without getting that annoying hair pulled headache feeling.<br /><br />I think my favorite are the middle ones, that have a small tail, they look super cute.

The aroma is soothing with natural fragrance. Not a hint of off chemical odors, just fresh essential oils, blended for a peaceful experience.<br />I especially like the petite candle that is a lovely way to complete the experience. You can have a candle lit bath using the bath gel, and spray the linens with the pillow spray for a calming and sleep inducing experience.<br /><br />Very caring gift for someone facing challenges and stress",B08P5579KC,1622043800786,5.0

Or you can mix it with any other skincare product or even a foundation, in order to make it more hydrating.<br />No fragrance whatsoever, so scent sensitive people will love this.<br />Another thing to appreciate is that the bottle and dropper are both glass.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />On its own or as an additive in a DIY creation, this may be clear, but it's liquid gold.",B08RRSPNWV,1618189050817,5.0
AEAXAJACFMXIAAH4WOHRMXPSZWFA,Good for Mature Skin,"Although I'm not thrilled that this didn't have a safety seal on it, the cream itself is very good. It's a heavy cream, despite the company identifying it as being light and whipped. It looks whipped in the jar, but it is not light on the face. I don't think it would be suitable for all ages. Because of the heaviness and intense moisturizing, I believe that mature skin is going to benefit most from using this.<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s, in a dry climate, with combination skin (T Zone) and some wrinkles as a point of concern.<br />This cream works very well with all of the above. I don't put it on my nose, of course, but when I feel like a splurge I put it on my hands because it's so moisturizing.<br />The claim that it moisturizes 24/7 is indeed true. Even in this dry area, my face feels hydrated all day when I use this cream.<br />It contains milk protein, yogurt extract, blueberry extract, rice protein, and a host of other skin-loving ingredients.<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to invest in this product. It is indeed generously sized at 3.4 oz, and it has a very high quality ingredients. But like I said, it's not going to be for everyone.<br /><br />xxoo",B08WF29DM9,1616524159797,5.0
AEAXAJACFMXIAAH4WOHRMXPSZWFA,Like a Peach Bellini for your Face!,"Do you like champagne cocktails? This one smells like a combination of peach and champagne, and even looks like it!<br />It comes out like a gel. It's activated by water, so after washing your face, leave your face damp and put a thin layer of the gel quickly all over your face. Include your neck if you like.<br />Then with each passing moment, it's going to get foamier and foamier. That's why you have to have a very thin coat. You only need a small amount of product. If you use too much, your face is going to foam up like you have shaving cream all over!<br /><br />After about 5 or 10 minutes, you massage a little bit with warm water and then rinse. After you dry your face it's going to feel squeaky clean. If you have dry skin, you're ready for a moisturizing serum and cream. If you have oily or acne prone skin, use the appropriate products for that skin type. I don't feel that this mask is drying, but it does leave you very clean.<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this is good for all skin types, as long as you use it as a brightening mask as opposed to a hydrating mask.<br />This is just what your skin needs if you have overdosed on hot humid weather.please look at the ingredients to see if you have any sort of allergy or if any of them are a trigger for any skin issues. Because I have sensitive skin that can be triggered, but I only left it on for about 4 minutes. I had absolutely no irritation, but I think if I had left it on longer, I might have. That doesn't mean it's bad for you. If you leave a mild castile soap, which is so gentle, on your face for any length of time, skin will be irritated.<br />Made in the USA, from Tonica Skin in Marblehead Massachusetts.<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to try this fun mask. It really does leave your skin feeling and looking energized, but it's a bit of an investment. Nice splurge for a spa night, and because the product comes out via a pump, it's going to be sanitary for all the participants.<br />It's going to make for some really fun and Instagram worthy photos!<br /><br />xxoo<br /><br />PS, my 'spa night' pal doesn't look too impressed 😆",B08VKQY815,1616359387784,5.0

Slightly citrus.<br />They contain willow bark extract, known for soothing inflammation.<br />No stickiness after rinsing.

I hate to say it, but for people with sensitive skin, sometimes a long list of natural ingredients isn’t really the best thing. Or at least it wasn’t for me. I feel very uncomfortable and I’m going to go wash my face now. Also, it smelled weirdly chocolatey, which is not something I expected at all, but it’s not a good smell in my opinion.

It goes on easily, just pump it out and spread it on thinly over your face. Make sure your face is damp so it has something to activate. It starts bubbling quickly and tickles a little and then a lot! The big clumps of bubbles will pop and flatten on your face and when most of them were popped I wet my hands and rubbed the mask on my face. After rinsing with a washcloth my face felt good and looked brighter. It had a little hydration to it, which was a bonus.

The side that sits on your forehead has a sticky strip to keep the cap from sliding and the side that goes on the base of your skull has a stretchy band to allow for sizing. The bow is cute and so is the pattern. I use these types of caps for incubating oil and deep conditioning masks.

There's a barrier cream that can be used as a hand lotion, charcoal exfoliating hand soap, and a thick hand cream. There is a faint scent, but it's clean smelling if anything. The soap says you can use it with or without water. I wouldn't eat anything with my hands without using water with it though. The heavy cream is really nice to out on just before bed, just the tiniest amount will take care of your hands. Both creams soak in quickly and aren't greasy at all.

There aren't any instructions other than to clear the tube in case it gets stuck. It says it's a continuous spray and through a brief trial and error I discovered you pump the handle to prime the spraying mechanism and that makes it basically a continuous spray. The pump is really easy to operate, you can easily squeeze it with one finger. When you put the top back on you have to push it down and then it's just like a half or quarter turn to keep it on. One of the questions was would I take it when I travel and it's a little too bulky to bring it with on all trips.

Directions said to put booties on feet. I wasnt sure if i should take them out of the plastic, so i didnt because there was alot of liquid in them. The packets also said to not use if you are breastfeeding or pregnant so that was concerning - not sure what is in it or how it effects milk, but i still pump for my daughter. I kept these securely on my feet for the directed amount of time and then took them off and took a shower. A couple days later my right foot started to peel first but got really itchy so i think i scratched off some of the peeling skin. The description says it will peel in about a week and leave skin smooth but my whole foot didnt peel and I still have patches of dried skin and calluses.

The spray top only has 2 options: off and on, and the on is a very fine misted spray- No stream setting like most bottles, so that could be a con depending on what you want to use it for.

Its easy to apply, rubs in and absorbs well but does feel a little sticky afterwards. It doesnt have much of a smell either maybe a little like lavender but gentle. Ive been doing one pump and rubbing it on her feet and she likes the little foot massage. I could tell it helps her sleep better. She wakes up/squirms less, maybe helping her get a deeper sleep.

I took a couple pictures showing and comparing my eyelashes before and after applying. The mascara was a little pastey but step 1 applied ok and looked fine, but step 2 completely ruined my eyelashes. It looked horrible; The left side got clumped together and the right side looked like my eyelashes were growing baby eyelashes. Very unnatural looking. This claims to be flake free but after it dried i noticed a few little black specks on my cheeks. I had to use one of my old dried up mascara brushes to separate my lashes to fix them. It's also very hard to wash off.",B081M5R5L5,1576352461065,1.0

These are all sturdy and comfortable, with no irritation to my head or behind my ears. I wear them and my kids all wear these so they fit everyone.

It reminds me of what you might get at a hotel. Unfortunately I absolutely hated the scent. It literally made me want to gag. It isn't floral or sweet but some kind of awful chemical smell.

I really like the scent and it lathers well - best of all it's made without the toxic chemicals most mainstream soaps and body washes are filled with. It has a refreshing scent, thanks to being made with essential oils.<br /><br />It's advertised as a soap that ""boosts immunity"" but I find that laughable - everyone is reminded constantly to wash your hands as a way to prevent the spread of COVID and that action, you could say, ""boosts"" your immunity given that COVID is no match for soap. But to say the soap gives you some immunity is a bit of a stretch. Except for this questionable marking slogan, I liked these soaps.",B086TS3BKQ,1605749827955,4.0

It's made with activated charcoal and has the coloring of charcoal, but thankfully not the scent! Under a hot shower it releases a nice minty scent and the hardy soap appears to less vulnerable to melting away in the soap dish unlike other softer soaps I've used. It's made for men but I don't see why women can't use it as well, as it's refreshing. It's best used for the face, as it cleans out your pores, but as I wash my face and body in the shower at the same time, it's a perfect face body combination soap.",B0845LNDJK,1603558302113,4.0
AH3BXW7KLIS2VAE56UXJS2NS7I5A,"Beautiful Bottle, May Use This as a Hand Soap","I have a weakness for beautifully decorated soap bottles. This Bouquet Garni bottle looks great and I'm tempted to use this as a hand soap rather than as a body wash just so I can display it on my sink. As for the scent, ""White Musk"" I don't like it as much. It's OK, but I prefer lavender but thought I'd give it a try. As a wash, it foams up nicely and leaves my skin feeling soft and cleansed. It's made in Korea, home to many high qualty skin care companies so I trust its quality (more so than if it's from China!).<br /><br />Again, I love the bottle so I'll be sure to re-use it after the body wash is all gone, but if I had to do it again, I'd choose a different scent.

The scent is ""mint and rosemary"" but I feel like it's mostly mint. It's a step up above your ordinary shower gel but it won't likely last as long, as it's hard to tell how much of the bottle you are actually using since it's not liquid.

It can also be reused as a regular wipe after the first use, just hang up and let dry. There isn't much of a scent, which is fine by me as strong fragranced wipes are bad for my allergies.

This is the secret behind the success of Ipsy and Birchbox. You get five travel sizes of the most popular and bestselling items sold by Caudalie: an eye cream, radiance serum, moisturizing sorbet, foaming cleanser, and beauty elixer. The eye cream was nice but I didn't see any effect on my wrinkles; the radiance serum made my skin feel great, as did the moisturizing sorbet. I think I liked the cleanser the most and the beauty elixer the least (it didn't do much for me). Considering that each one is costly for a full size version, it's great to be able to know which one is right for me before purchasing.

AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,Soothing and hydrating. 5 stars⭐,"I love how this Essence has such soothing and hydrating ingredients. I've just recently started using K-beauty products, but the first one I tried left my skin very irritated. This one feels so light, but moisturizing. I'm just learning about a lot of the ingredients that are in most Korean beauty products, and I'm also Learning that some of them do not do well with my skin. This one works wonderfully for me. I use Retin-A, so anything really harsh or very exfoliating is too much. The first one made my skin very red, swollen, and angry looking. This one feels very nice on my skin and I love the way my skin is looking and feeling now. I would definitely recommend it! Especially, for those using Retin-A or those with very sensitive skin.",B084WP4XS8,1622096060469,5.0
AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,Much more than just hyaluronic acid! Very moisturizing and best fitting for my face. 5 stars⭐,"I love these masks! For the price and how many you get, I was surprised to find the plastic backing. I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br />It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br />I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br />I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish. I usually discard the small pieces that cover the nose and upper lip. I then take those four pieces, put them back in the serum that's left in the package remoisten them, with these that is no problem, or just add a little hyaluronic acid serum to moisten them again, put them on my neck and decollete area the best I can, and wait another 15 or 20 minutes. This really lets me get the most possible use out of every mask.<br />I really love these masks and all of the skin loving ingredients they contain. They make my face feel wonderful afterwards and the effects last all day, if not longer. These are definitely on my must-have list. Highly recommend!",B08XZDXTG2,1620378771291,5.0
AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,Formaldehyde?! Not safe. 2 Stars ⭐,"After going over the ingredients in these products, the only two I would feel even remotely safe using would be this shampoo and conditioner. As a hair stylist, you do not want to use a product that contains formaldehyde and apply heat to it. You certainly do not want to use it every 6 weeks, as it's harmful to your health. It can cause breathing issues among other things. It's very hard to believe that I even saw actual formaldehyde on the back of this product, and so high up in the ingredients list.<br />Even hair stylist must wear protective gear, such as gloves, aprons, masks, and be trained how to safely work with this hazardous chemical. Salons must have adequate ventilation and follow strict protocols regarding blow dryer temperatures and monitor formaldehyde levels at all times when they provide Keratin Treatments containing formaldehyde because of the immediate and long term health dangers.This is something you cannot possibly do at home.<br />Also, the pretreatment that you add to the shampoo is extremely strong and stripping to your hair. When they say add just a little, no one knows what that means. That particular product, or the two main ingredients, should only be a small percentage of the product you're adding it to. I don't think you can mix this properly at home without causing damage to your hair and/or your skin.<br />I ""might"" use the shampoo and conditioner, but I will not touch the pre-treatment nor will I touch the DIY home keratin treatment. Over the course of a few treatments, I can see this product going really awry for some people. They will end up with damaged hair and possibly other problems. It is not safe. I absolutely would not recommend it!",B07SLFWZKN,1616470171498,2.0
AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,"Very moisturizing, but leaves too much oil behind. 3.5 stars ✨","The name of these masks really throws you off. It makes you think they are supposed to be used with an LED light, but they are not. Upon opening one of the mask packages, I wasn't expecting a gooey, in between a cream and lotion, to start leaking out. It's not like a Serum at all.<br />The mask itself is quite thin, but it's not at all easy to tear. I read that one reviewer commented that it rips easily. On the contrary, it's quite difficult to even tear it. I actually had to use scissors to cut it for a use that I will explain later. It is a good size, covering all areas quite well. The cutouts for the eyes are quite small, which I like because it really gets to the under-eye area without it getting into your eyes.<br />I left it on for 20 minutes, and then did as another reviewer did, and cut it up and put it on my neck & decollete for another 20 minutes, with the rest of the cream/lotion that was left in the package.<br />This mask is extremely moisturizing and did not sink into my skin completely afterwards. I had used Retin-A the night before, so my face was quite dry, and really needed moisture and nutrients. But, I think it is a little too oily for my skin. My skin was still so oily hours later that I had to blot it with a microfiber facial cloth. The next day my skin felt great, though, without any ill effects.<br />These are very moisturizing and emollient masks, and would be great for someone with extremely dry skin. For me, I think these will work well using them once a week or every other week, when my skin is at its driest. For five masks, I think the price point is just right. I would definitely recommend these. Especially for those with very dry skin.",B083B67373,1614679036865,4.0
AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,"Somewhat good in theory, not so great in reality. 2.5 Stars ✨","This mirror really wants to be elegant looking. It has a pearlized finish with some elegant swirls at the top, but it really just looks like a plastic vanity mirror that should come with one of the Barbie mannequin heads that little girls put makeup on and do their hair.<br />The mirror has three light settings, bright white, really yellow, and I'm assuming a daylight, which is the only light I can somewhat see myself a little bit with it on. Really, it's just awful trying to see in this mirror with the light on. This is the first lighted mirror that I've experienced this with. For some reason, the light seems to shadow your face somehow, or either it's just the wrong color or brightness, and you can hardly see yourself in the mirror at all. And, no matter which mirror I want to look in, I have to pick the mirror up and bring it close to my face. And even then, I feel like I'm looking at light, and not my face being brightened by the light.<br />Also, once put together, the fold out mirrors do not stay flush when folded in. It gives it the look like you've broken it and are just living with it like that. And, I find the fold out mirrors very cumbersome to look at myself in them, with the light on or off. Especially the bottom one that has the most magnification, which really should have been on the top, in my opinion. If I don't pick it up, I have to bend way down to see in the bottom one, and then I can only see half of my face if the light is on. The other half is in a shadow, whether the light is on or off. The upper mirror is just as hard to see in, as my face is shadowed on one side very heavily if the light is on. It's just an awkward design.<br />This mirror seemed somewhat good in theory, but because of the very poor design and the lack of quality materials, it is rendered nearly useless. Each mirror, in and of itself, is nice and clear and seems great. One might think of recycling them, or a young girl may find better use of this vanity mirror as she's playing dress up, or learning to do makeup. For myself, because I cannot see into it with the lights on, as it's meant to be used, and I don't find it aesthetically pleasing to display, I will not be using it.",B08N6CLJ6P,1613555086658,3.0
AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,Nice quality bottles with lots of the goodies! 5 stars ✨,"These are good quality thick amber colored bottles, and they arrived very well packed. I love that they come with a funnel, labels, marking pen, a dropper, and screw top lids along with the sprayer tops. They work great for making my witch hazel facial toner spray and colloidal silver spray. The sprayers work pretty well, although the sprayer part spins around freely. It makes them feel a little clumsy and uneasy to grab hold of. The price for these is on the high side of what I would normally pay for a set like this.

AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,These are not USDA certified oils. 2 stars ✨,"First, I will say these oils seem fine. They work well together or apart, mixed into other skincare products or alone. I use these types of oils to make my own facial oil mix or to add to my moisturizer.<br />The thing I absolutely hate that companies do to try to sell their products is to say things that aren't true. The USDA does not certify oils - food, cosmetic, or otherwise. The fact that the bottle says this product is USDA certified on one side, and the other side says not intended for ingestion should speak volumes. The USDA certifies and regulates the welfare and production of food products; meaning products that you ingest. So, why on earth would they certify a product you cannot ingest? The bottle also makes outright claims of known cures from using these oils. There is no disclaimer on either bottle that states that these claims have not been approved or proven by the FDA, or whatever the disclaimer is that is mandatory. There are ingredients listed, one ingredient for each product, the oil, and that's it. Nothing tells how these oils were extracted. Therefore, we do not know if they are refined or unrefined. They probably don't know either. So you see, therein lies the lies and deception.<br />These oils would be much better if they weren't tied to lies. Because you know what they say about lies... if you tell one you have to tell more to keep up with the first one. Is what they say in the bottle really what's in the bottle? Are they pure oils or mixed with a lesser oil? Oils are greasy. If they are unrefined, why aren't they greasy? When you refine oils, you take away a lot of their natural properties and their nutritive value, is that why they aren't greasy? Because of the lies and lack of important information, I really don't know for sure what these oils are.<br />Because of the deceptive practices and claims made, I would not recommend these or any of their other oils.",B08LYT4Q2X,1609415095648,2.0
AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,Nice but missing the clips... 3 stars ✨,"These travel-size bottles are really nice. I love that they are a larger size so that I can use them for hand sanitizer and facial care products. The ones for hand sanitizer can easily fit in my handbag and carry bag, and the ones for my facial care products fit nicely on the small caddy I have in my bathroom. They are easy to fill from my large pump containers, which is a plus. My only issue is that mine are missing the clips that go on them. It's not so terrible for the few that I use in my bathroom, but it is for the ones I use for hand sanitizer. It makes it harder to find them in my purse and bag. Hopefully, no one else has this problem. I would definitely recommend them if you get the clips.",B08HRHCZV2,1609114164865,3.0
AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,"Uhh.... ok, will use for skincare routine, then. 3.5 stars ✨","When I saw these I was so excited because they match most of my wardrobe. I'm always wearing my hair up and love wearing skinny hard headbands with ponytails to keep straggly hairs back. I thought this would be something new to try altogether.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this fabric is awful to wear in your hair. I am a seamstress and it is definitely synthetic and feels like it. It's slippery, hot, and doesn't' feel nice at all. The design seems like an afterthought, as it will not stay in place.<br /><br />So, I've had a big change of plans! I will be using these during my skincare routine and putting on my makeup. At least these headbands will get some use. I'm constantly losing the ones I have, so now I have plenty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3.5 stars for effort and couldn't bear to recommend them. Sorry.",B08BYK8SKR,1599367501622,4.0
AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,Acrylic girl tries Polygel for the first time...crazy different!,"This was my first experience with poly gel, and I can't say that it was an easy and straightforward one. I did do some research and watched several videos to learn the process before even venturing into trying my own. Boy, I had NO idea what I had gotten myself into... This is nothing like my beloved Acrylics! But, for a little laugh, and a few Pro ""lift proof"" tips along the way, I've added a video at the top to show my adventure.<br /><br />First, none of the nail forms seem to come close to fitting any of my nails properly, and my mind could not even grasp this whole strange concept not one bit. So, I just added a tip and began to apply the gel as I would acrylic. The gel is extremely thick and sticky and very hard to work with, unlike the gel from the past. The kit did not include a slip solution, which would be hard for those just starting out and may not have 70% alcohol at home. I did have some, but it really didn't help, aside from keeping the brush clean, as the gel was so thick and almost unworkable. It took me about 20 minutes to complete one nail from start to finish, including polish. <br /><br />It was quite frustrating that none of the boxes for the Polish were marked, neither did they have curing times noted. The instructions also did not include this information for the polishes. But, in the end, I had a pretty nice looking poly gel nail for the first time ever.<br /><br />I appreciate that the kit comes with all the necessities, aside from the slip solution. It also contains quite a few glitters and tapes to get creative. The light is very small, but it gets the job done, even if it takes a few extra seconds. Once the nail is cured, you get a very hard and shiny finish. The polishes are very nice, although I don't care for a few of the colors myself, the topcoat is very thick.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice kit. I enjoyed the learning experience and will likely play around with it again. And, I may try those strange nail form attachment things. Although I could have done over half a set of nails in acrylic in the time it took to do my one nail in polygel~~ everyone has to start somewhere, it's always fun to learn something new and the first time usually takes the longest.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit for those starting out new and fresh, or those who are seasoned a bit doing poly gel. You definitely get a lot for your money, and you will get a nice strong nail from this kit. I'm giving 4 stars ✨ for the lack of information on the packaging and instructions on colors and curing times. But, I really do think I will like it much better once I get the hang of it.",B087G54FLM,1598739212520,4.0
AELHYMCYVS6T35HA3UH5UGFWTK6Q,Nice Laser Removal Tool,"I'll say it, I hate shaving.  The older I get the more hair I get on my upper lip.  Horrible.<br />So I am now trying this laser tool to see if it'll help with at least most of my unwanted hair.<br />I haven't been using it long.  I clean and then I shave the areas that I want to laser treat.<br />I would say that after about 3 weeks/3 times a week, you'll see at least a little difference if not a big difference.<br />The device is easy to hold in one hand.<br />Says that it will last my lifetime.  And it probably will.  The  most I'll be using it is the first month or two.  After that I expect only maintenance use.<br />No counter to count down the number of used flashes.  But it's okay.  Not a big deal.<br />It does have to be plugged in.  Again, not an issue.  I only have it out, while using it, for about 10 mins tops.  Takes me 2 seconds to plug it in.<br />Love having this.  Anything that makes a day go a bit easier is okay with me.",B08VJ7CZW3,1626814751837,4.0
AELHYMCYVS6T35HA3UH5UGFWTK6Q,Nice variety,It's so hard to find good tweezers that actually grab the hair.  These tweezers seem to work nicely.<br />I tried 3 of them so far and I have no complaints.<br />The case is nice to keep them all organized and easy to find.  The eyebrow brush was a nice addition to this set.<br />The curved scissors work great also.<br />Glad to have this set in my collection.  Will make it so much easier when I need to do a bit of face grooming.,B08C2T24WG,1607964272315,5.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Good Enough,I have bleached blonde hair with a lot of silver mixed in.  I color it at home and if I don't use products to control brassiness my hair will start to turn kind of orangish.  I really like this shampoo.  It's nice and dark purple and lathers up really nice.  It cleans my hair well and thoroughly rinses out.  The creme rinse doesn't do much as far as conditioning or de-tangling but should help to keep hair from color warping.  It's not as dark purple as the shampoo and has no scent that I can detect.,B08QKXY1KN,1624113542325,4.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Very Good Lotion,"This is a nice set of 4, 2.53 fl. oz. tubes of moisturizing lotion.  My hands and face feel nicely hydrated and there's no annoying scent to deal with.  These are the perfect size for a purse, backpack or pocket and they seem reasonably priced.  As of this review a set of 4 only costs $14.25.",B01M24DUXH,1621461495758,5.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Pretty Headbands,"These are pretty, pastel colored cloth covered headbands.  I like the scrunchie look they have.  They hold my hair out of my face very well and don't bother me much around the backs of my ears.  Sometimes head bands start to hurt my head but so far these haven't.  They're not super good quality - about a dollar each, but they do what I want them to do.",B08QHP717Z,1619886116268,4.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Good Collagen Supplement,"If you mix up approximately 2 tablespoons (close enough to 1 and 2/3rds) you can sort of taste the berry flavor but it's basically bland and flavorless.  That's fine, you can add a flavoring to it if you want too.  As far as helping me get to sleep it doesn't.  1mg of melatonin does nothing for me.  I like that one serving delivers 10 mg of collagen but it's only one type - bovine collagen.  I think it's kind of pricey coming in at $34.95 (as of this review) since I've reviewed collagen powders that contains several types of collagen and were more than 9.3 oz for as much or even less money.  Also, you won't see any results in 2 weeks so don't let those reviews get you all excited.  I've been consuming collagen on a daily basis for about a year and am now just beginning to see some positive changes in my skin and nails.  I'm 63 and realize all the collagen supplements in the world won't make me look 40 again but I have seen some improvements in less crinkly skin on my arms and some fine lines around my eyes looking much smoother.  Collagen is not the fountain of youth but it does help if you are patient and consistent.",B08XQYZWCS,1619365433281,4.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Very Good Hair Brush,This is the perfect sized boar bristle hair brush to put in my purse or tennis bag.  It's not too small but it's not full-sized either.  I love these types of brushes the best (especially those with bamboo bristles) because they brush all of my hair and not just the top of it.  It feels good on my scalp too.  The wood grain in the brown handle is lovely too making it a pretty brush as well as very functional.,B08JTNQFZY,1614364761422,5.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Seems to be Good Shampoo and Conditioner,"The shampoo comes out of the bottle really DARK blue but lathers up nice and white.  It cleans my hair nicely, rinses out easily and has no strong or perfumed scent at all.  I have been lightening my hair using home kits and prefer shampoos and creme rinses that help control any brassiness.  The conditioner is a much lighter color and makes my hair feel great.  It's easy to comb out and blow dry.  However, it will leave your shower floor very slick so be careful with this stuff.",B08GMC48QF,1612911742143,5.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Very Good but Pricey,"This is a little jar of face cream for $27.98 (the price as of this review).  It feels good on my facial skin, but honestly, it doesn't moisturize it any better than many less expensive creams I've used and reviewed.  It's good, but I just don't see why it costs so much money.  The texture is close to that of sour cream and it's easy to apply.  It's a little greasy for a short while until it gets absorbed.",B07W1WJZFG,1612308654407,4.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Very Good Shampoo,I like this castor oil shampoo though I don't know how much castor oil it contains.  Castor oil is wonderful for hair and skin and I use a lot of it in my hand made soaps because it makes them very emollient and soothing to the skin.  This is a huge bottle of shampoo and will last me a long time.  It makes very good lather - nice and light and it rinses out well.  My hair is very clean afterwards.  I still use a good conditioner afterwards because my hair is a little damaged from being lightened.  This shampoo has a very light scent too.  There's nothing negative I can find to say about it.,B087ZQG11L,1611251386013,5.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Excellent Natural Deodorant,"I checked the ingredients list of this non-aluminum containing deodorant and everything that's in it is what I put in my own home made deodorants.  Shea buttter, coconut oil, arrowroot powder, cornstarch, essential oils, etc...  It has a lovely scent, and you don't need much.  It won't stop sweating, but it will keep the smelly bacteria from breeding for a while so you don't stink.  I could feel the slight graininess of the cornstarch and arrowroot powder which let me know it was good quality.  I really like this and feel it is every bit as good as my own homemade deodorant.",B086MN4SRX,1598796812774,5.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Very Well Made Metal Headbands,"These headbands are made out of strong metal and are well painted.  I like them but find that the tips are a little irritating - need more rubber on the them.  The wavy part sort of grabs my hair in a comb-backed way, but not all of it so I have to decide it I want my front hair loose or try to get the waves to comb more of it back.  These are very well made and should last a long time.  I haven't tried wearing more than one at a time but that might be a good idea.",B08D6PPL42,1597848408177,4.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Good Bamboo Brush with Comb,"I love bamboo brushes with bamboo bristles.  They feel so good on my scalp - like a scalp massage when I brush my hair with them.  This brush is really good, though I would have liked for the bristles pegs to be a little longer.  I find I have to push the brush down harder to get to my scalp.  I have another bamboo brush with longer bristles that I like best but this one is still a very good brush especially if you have short hair.  The comb that comes with it is good for getting tangles out of thick hair and one of my kids has laid claim to it.",B08BY9P4HR,1597671635724,4.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,These Work Great,These are just what I need to keep some loose hairs around my face from flying around and getting into my eyes.  I played a tennis match yesterday and the wind was just ferocious.  If I didn't have these little barrettes in my hair I would have gone nuts.  These are perfect for when you need a lot of them at one time like I did yesterday.  I think I had at least 8 of them in my hair at one time but they looked fine and I like the choice of colors and they worked perfectly.,B07XVNJFNF,1583082404268,5.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Very Good Lip Balm,"I pretty much have chronically dry, chapped lips, especially in the winter.  I'm frequently grabbing my lip glosses, balms, and anything greasy that I can put on them.  I find that this Pharmacopia Tangerine-Flavored Lip Balm is very soothing to my poor lips and really makes them feel so nicely moisturized.  It goes on easily and is clear if I want to use some on the back of my dry hands when I can't find any lotion.  I can't really taste any tangerine flavor, but the scent is definitely there and is very pleasant.",B07Z3NRMBS,1580925509624,5.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Too Expensive for What You Get,"I've reviewed other lotions that were pricey like this one, as of this review this Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion costs $25.90.  I think that's kind of expensive because though it's a good moisturizer, it's not a great moisturizer.  I can put it on my face, arms and hands and it feels good, but my skin is not as moisturized as some other lotions and creams that I've used.  I like the shape of the bottle because I can keep it in the slot in my car door and use it as needed.  But, I wouldn't be real thrilled if I paid nearly $26.00 for a 6.8 fl. oz bottle of this lotion and only got an average level of moisturization.",B07SW7D6ZR,1580763310383,3.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,These Work OK,"These face lift tapes aren't bad as long as you don't get your hopes up that you will look 20 years younger.  I'm nearly 62 and my facial skin is sagging - the reason for me selecting these face lift tapes when they appeared on my list of items I could review.  Your skin must be clean, dry and free of any moisturizers.  They stick well to my skin and definitely pulls it up some.  However, the skin that's pulled up gets crinkled up and if your hair doesn't cover it, the crinkles will show.  The tapes are really hard to see once applied, and easy to apply once you get the hang of it.  I blew through at least 10 just trying to figure it out but you get 40 in a box.  Again, these do work, and help eliminate some drooping skin, but they aren't a really good solution, imho.",B07VG2W8TT,1580489576092,3.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Organic Argan Oil???  I Don't Think So,"I was really happy to receive this 4 oz. bottle of ""Organic Moroccan Argon Oil"" but it does not appear to be very organic nor pure argan oil.  It's loaded with other chemicals, and perfume.  Upon opening the bottle I wondered why it had a scent, was clear and somewhat thin.  I have several other brand of PURE Argan oil and it is thick, yellowish and has a musty/dirt-like scent.  I can't give this Livordo Argan oil a high star rating since what it advertises doesn't seem to be what you get.",B081632HX6,1579538077798,2.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,These Will Shave Off Facial Hair Just Fine,"I've never seen anything like these facial razors before so when they came up on my list of items I could review curiosity got the better of me.  That said, they aren't bad.  I'm at that age where I might spring an unwanted facial hair or two which I have to remove immediately upon detection.  I used (carefully!) one of these small razors to try shaving just a small area of my face and it really did remove all the peach fuzz.  I can't say that they are any better than a ladies electric facial shaver I've been using, but these would be a lot easier to carry in my purse just in case I needed to use one.  They seem well made and one razor should last a long time.  These are sharp, but kind of serrated at the edge so be careful with them.",B07R3BMYBG,1561175469968,4.0
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,Good Mask,This mask is very soft and molds itself around my bird beak nose pretty well.  I can still detect the tiniest bit of light but it's a lot better than any of my other masks I have for blocking out light.,B07HN1L8NQ,1552755307572,4.0
AGYVC7KVHP2AWM7BDCEYNHFA6F3Q,Natural wipes but expensive,"The wipes have a strong lemon scent and use natural ingredients.  The pack has 20 individually wrapped wipes that can be used on the skin or to clean in the home.  They're not chemical disinfectant wipes, I mainly use them for my hands, etc and nearby surfaces when traveling because I enjoy the strong natural lemon scent.

AGYVC7KVHP2AWM7BDCEYNHFA6F3Q,Non-greasy lotion with hyaluronic acid,"I always have lotion on hand so these individually packed tubes of lotion from South Korea are a good fit for me.  I like the feel and texture of the lotion - non greasy and effective. As a lotion, it is excellent but the scents are not particularly attractive. I've tried the Olive and the Green Tea scented versions and am not particularly drawn to the scents. The green tea is a bit too sweet and doesn't smell like green tea, so I've deducted 1 star.",B01MA3LXIL,1621093755887,4.0
AGYVC7KVHP2AWM7BDCEYNHFA6F3Q,"Lightweight, non-greasy and hydrating hand lotion","This set has four individually packaged travel sized tubes of hand lotion from South Korea.  The lotion light, non-greasy and is quickly absorbed into the skin. While the scent is a little sweet for my taste, I love the feel and texture of the lotion.  It doesn't have the lotion feel after a few minutes but my hands stay well hydrated and soft.",B01M24DUXH,1619703641584,4.0

I'm new to the Ogana Cell brand but knowing that the brand is created by a South Korean dermatologist caught my attention. I have had very good experience with South Korean skincare at different price points.<br /><br />This Amazing Lotion has a light texture, similar to a serum. I have combination sensitive skin and need anti-aging products.  I found that this worked very well for me.  There is a light fruity scent but the lotion doesn't feel sticky or oily and is quickly absorbed into the skin. It looks matte but hydrates well and left my skin feeling very soft.  The lotion strengthens the skin barrier but doesn't have the slightly oily feel of many products that have the same purpose.  I also like that the lotion helps to increase collagen -- at my age this makes a difference.",B07RBSLNFR,1618074273765,5.0
AGYVC7KVHP2AWM7BDCEYNHFA6F3Q,Gentle and effective 50 SPF,"I was late to use sunblock regularly.  The older versions were too whitish and thick, uncomfortable on the skin.  This South Korean version with 50 SPF is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not leave any whitish color or streaks.  It does not feel oily or sticky but instead more like a light lotion.  It does not use parabens - the product list shows the harsh ingredients that the sunscreen does not contain.  Aside from SPF, the sunblock also has moisturizing ingredients.  It is easy to use this everyday without causing a breakout or irritation of the skin.",B08NJ5BTWG,1617730415402,5.0

AGYVC7KVHP2AWM7BDCEYNHFA6F3Q,Gentle and effective oxygen whip foam,"I've tried a few oxygen whip cleansers and this compares well with the famous Japanese brands.

Mizon is a well regarded South Korean skincare brand and its cleansing balm was gentle but effective.  It comes solid in the jar with a small scoop that helps keep your fingers from touching the balm.  After rubbing the balm together it turns liquid and goes on gently into the skin. I rubbed it further into my skin to help it cleanse deeply. The cleansing balm didn't feel greasy or sticky.  I  left it on for a few minutes and rinsed. My skin felt clean and very soft.

I've been careful to only use retinol at night and to avoid direct sunlight after using retinol.  This serum does not specifically warn against going under direct sun, but it is worth taking the precaution.<br /><br />I liked the texture of the Face Oil Retinol Serum - it feels like a dry oil and is easily absorbed into the skin. It doesn't feel oily or sticky but it moisturizes. It helps improve the firmness and tone.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and did not experience any redness, irritation, or sensitivity using this.",B07NPCT6L5,1605127328258,4.0

This set has their famous vinosource serum that contains the antioxidants from grape seeds.  This Vinosource serum smells lovely, is quickly absorbed into the skin, and hydrates deeply. It's a lightweight and effective serum that leaves my skin feeling pampered and very soft.  It works very well during the dry cold months of autumn and winter.<br /><br />The cleanser is gentle but effective.  The moisturizing cream has a lovely scent and the antioxidants that have made the brand famous.  It is particularly welcome during the cold, dry months.

I am new to the Laloirelle brand and  was intrigued by the description of this Luminous Face Oil.  I'd used different face oils in the past with varying success.  I have oily skin in parts (T zone) and sensitive skin.<br /><br />This Luminous Face Oil combines several high quality antioxidants to help moisten and brighten the skin.  I found the face oil was not quickly absorbed into the skin.  I would prefer to use this at night because of the time it takes for the oil to be absorbed.  I did wake up with well hydrated skin. Considering the high cost of this face oil, I had expected it to standout. I may have to use it for an extended time before I feel or see results.<br /><br />I did not experience any redness, irritation or sensitivity.",B08DXLRTSB,1601955064771,4.0
AGYVC7KVHP2AWM7BDCEYNHFA6F3Q,Deep hydration but matte look,"I'm always interested in trying new skincare innovations, products and brands. I'm new to Follain and find this mattifying moisturizer to be effective and high quality. The moisturizer is a little thick and hydrates deeply without feeling greasy or oily at all.  It does take a while for all of the moisturizer to be fully absorbed but it leaves my face feeling very soft and hydrated.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin but noticed  no sensitivity, redness or irritation.",B08CL46XNM,1599521785894,5.0

I'm new to this American brand MD Complete but found the Vitamin C serum nicely packaged and high quality.<br /><br />I use different serums in the morning and at night. This Vitamin C is a little thicker than what I usually use and is feels a bit oily -- but going on it is absorbed quickly and doesn't leave the skin feeling greasy.  I would use it at night though.  It felt deeply hydrating and the Vitamin C helps brighten and even out skin tone.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin but did not experience any irritation, sensitivity or redness using this product.",B08BZ1RHPS,1599343751672,4.0
AGYVC7KVHP2AWM7BDCEYNHFA6F3Q,Facial oil with Resveratrol,"This lipid facial oil comes quite pricey at $70 but it also gives you a large portion of 60 ml or 2 oz.  Most of my serums come in 1 oz bottles, so while $70 is high it is not outrageous.<br /><br />The facial oil is made in the USA and contains Resveratrol which helps combat aging.  Resveratrol comes from grapes and has strong antioxidants.  This Essential Lipid Power Infusion also contains argan oil, rose hip oil, and a mix of extracts.<br /><br />I found this Essential Lipid Power Infusion to stay on my skin for a relatively long time. It left my skin feeling a bit greasy but once absorbed it felt very soft and well hydrated.  I agree with the other reviewers that recommend using this in the evening because of the time that it takes for the oil to be absorbed.",B07DFNPVSF,1597929195215,5.0
AGYVC7KVHP2AWM7BDCEYNHFA6F3Q,Caudalie traveling kit with favorites,"I love trying new skincare products and brands from overseas. I've found French skincare products to be particularly innovative and high quality even when they are not expensive. Caudalie is well known internationally and has a spa in New York City's Plaza Hotel.  It's products are among those always listed in a search of ""what skincare should I buy while in Paris"" or ""What items should I buy at at French pharmacy?""<br /><br />This travel kit with the favorite products is a relatively inexpensive way to try a range of Caudalie skincare and their distinctive ingredients. The brand is known for their use of the grapeseeds from a vineyard and discovering the antioxidants help to combat aging and free radicals.  This kit has some of their more expensive creams in small doses, so you can try the range of creams (Vinoperfect, Premier Cru, Vinosource and the famous Beauty Elixir and Instant Foaming Cleanser.  It comes in a zippered tote perfect for traveling.  I love this set and plan to get one for my mother.

I'm new to this brand but found this Cica cream to work very well. It immediately cooled and soothed my irritated skin without any greasiness or oiliness. It was quickly absorbed into the skin.  It left my skin feeling much softer, less irritated, soothed. It is something I plan to keep on hand.",B0859CYSTM,1593008961947,5.0
AGYVC7KVHP2AWM7BDCEYNHFA6F3Q,A little goes a long way - effective cleanser,"This cleanser comes in a simple, colorful, & attractive red-and-white package.  It spreads well over the skin and has a light feel.  A little of it really goes a long way.<br /><br /> It is easy to remove and makes one feel fresh and clean after application.<br /><br />The one drawback is that instructions are not given in English (only in Korean) so one is left unsure whether it needs rinsing or wiping it up with tissue is enough.  There needs to be an  English translation on the box in order to reach the international market.",B07PHWX88W,1579786502355,5.0
AGYVC7KVHP2AWM7BDCEYNHFA6F3Q,Natural ingredient hair refresher,"This AG Hair Natural Remedy Apple Cider Vinegar is relatively expensive at $20 for a small bottle, but it is made of natural ingredients like apple cider vinegar, organic argan oil and protein from quinoa.  The spray is supposed to refresh the scalp and the hair, to reduce irritation to the scalp and to help soften hair.  I have been trying different scalp treatments and was eager to see how this would work.  It is less of a scalp treatment and more of a hair refresher but it does add bounce and lift to my hair.",B0BG6WX4DH,1545432287894,4.0
AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ,Just what I needed for my old furgirl,"I have a rescued teacup poodle that is a frightened little diva when I try to groom her.  I don't think the people who took care of her were nice or gentle with her in any way.  Poor little thing is only 4.5 pounds and she's fairly old and toothless so it's not like she'd turn and bite anyone trying to keep her looking like the pretty little girl she is.  I got this brush for her fine, curly hair.  She is a sweet little girl, but will ""bleat"" if she thinks you intend to hurt her and the first time I put a brush to her, she was shivering like I was going to do something bad to her.  I talked to her and took my time and by the time I was done, she was relaxed and let me work on her a little at a time.  My other furgirl is an older, rescued papillion and because her fur is straight with no undercoat, this brush works great on her.  She doesn't mind the brush at all and I think she likes how it lightly ""scratches"" her skin at the same time. Great brush for my two old girls!",B08KY7VYDS,1613366649688,5.0
AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ,Works well for what I need,"Yeah, I have a physical job that requires I wear a mask while working.  I work in an non-air-conditioned warehouse so I sweat...having a headband that can catch some of the sweat trying to drip into my eyes helps, but now with having to wear the mask, having the buttons on the headband allows me to combine the two instead of having to try to hook the mask's elastic behind my ears and then pull the headband over my ears and getting it situated on my forehead.  Life has changed and finding the best way to work with the new normal is the only way to go...and this headband is working for me - maybe it will work to make it easier for others!",B088FBNQXW,1594324006442,4.0
AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ,"I don't have ""broken"" hair","But I have baby-fine hair that is also curly.  I always have hair around the hairline that will NOT lay flat or blend into the rest of my hair whether it is pulled back or down.  Oh, and don't even get me started on humid/rainy days.  Curly hair, especially baby-fine curly hair, frizzes like crazy in humidity.  So yeah, I could spray the crap out of my hair with hairspray and have one great helmet head with not a hair out of place, but I absolutely hate hairspray.  Besides, that would require washing my hair every time I coat it with hairspray - the problem is baby-fine, dry hair isn't made to be washed daily.  So...I have lived with all those crazy ""free-wheeling"" hairs until trying this product.  It worked so well I was amazed and it did not leave my hair feeling like a hair helmet!  I used the mascara-like wand around the hairline from one ear to the other and those little hairs stayed in place!  Cool beans!  I will buy this again, definitely.",B0842BXM5M,1593282636613,5.0
AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ,I decided not to cut my hair this summer,"Usually I get a ""summer cut"" so that my hair doesn't make me any hotter during the summer months, but with the pandemic and all the salons closed, my hair is going to stay long over the hot summer months.  I can do many things with it and one is to keep it away from my face with these headbands.  I like the colors and the headbands themselves hold firmly in place which is just what I wanted.  I have some that had a twist in them and for some reason, they don't hold in place on my head very well like these do.

AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ,This is an all-inclusive package for those wanting to get into gel nail polish,"I mean, you aren't starting with tons of colors or anything, but when you are new to gel nail polish, keeping it simple is the best way to begin the process.  The two colors are nice, but I am sure once a person starts gel polish, they will love it and buy a set of colors that suit them.  Now, the only thing I would change about this set is the UV light as it is very small.  I already had a larger one and am comfortable using my big one as I can fit all four fingers under it with ease.  Not that I have fat fingers or anything, but I just feel the included UV light is a tad smaller than most women would like.  Other than that, this kit will get absolutely anyone started properly in the gel nail polishing procedure.",B0813ZQG3T,1584074031485,5.0

These clips are about the only type of clips that work well in keeping my wispy hair in place for any length of time.  The only thing that was a problem with these is that the side of the plastic these came in had torn and they were all over the shipping box.  I mean aaalllll ooovvvveeerrr inside the shipping box.

I love how these look on my head and they do a great job of keeping my hair back from my face when I'm working around the house.  I mean, I've used scrunchies to pull my hair up on my head, but after a little while that hurts my scalp.  These are gentle on both my hair and my scalp and they do look good (at least to me) on my head!",B0837K9W6P,1581056475206,5.0
AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ,"Straight razor with a ""guard""","That's basically what this is.  First off, the box is written in Chinese, I believe, with absolutely no English on it.  No instructions other than a pair of pictures.  Not great pictures either.  Not to be deterred, I opened the box, pulled one of the razors from the box, removed the plastic cover and tried it.  If you look closely at the one picture, you will see what appears to be a drop of blood - it is.  That is why I described this as a straight razor with a guard in quotes.  Make NO mistake, these are SHARP.  Use them delicately and only on smooth skin.  If you have a blemish, a mole or anything just slightly raised on your skin, it will be cut off.  You will bleed.

It does take several weeks and several sessions to notice a difference.  Plan on at least a half hour per session (depending on how large of an area you are doing.

AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,Nice scent,"I'm not usually a fan of flower scented sprays, but my wife loves them so we gave this a try.  I was shocked at how well I enjoyed this scent.  It was floral, but not the usual sickey sweet scent I usually associate with floral scents.  This one was a lot better and almost woodsey smelling.  My wife loves it and was thrilled that I liked it too so now out whole house smells like this and she is happy and I can tolerate it!  Worth a go for sure!",B08T7GPT1D,1625069103303,5.0

Works amazing for color treated hair, and perfect from stripped hair.  The conditioner is also incredible. I used some on my beard and it made it amazingly soft and manageable.

AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,Granddaughter loves this,"My granddaughter (13) is real into nails right now and loves this set.  She did her own nails and her friends nails and I will say they did a nice job.  She said this was easy to use and worked as well as any other set she has tried.  Colors were great and the nails were strong and easy to shape perfectly.  The only real problem we had was this does have a pretty nasty smell, but we set up a fan and that took care of the fumes.  She has added this set to her growing collection of nail stuff, and likes to come over every couple of weeks to open up her ""salon""  I like it cause I get to spend some extra time with my granddaughter.",B088TXBCB5,1610285483064,5.0
AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,Nice set,I use tweezers a lot and these are pretty decent ones.  They work for holding small screws and reaching hard to reach spots.  Not super fine tips but work for my needs.  I did sharpen and shape the pointed set a bit to use to remove some solder flux in a very tight spot.  Handy for most any detail work.  Scissors are so-so and will probably get trashed pretty quick in the shop.  The case is super handy and keeps the set together and is easy to slip into a pocket to take with you.  These would work pretty good as eyebrow tweezers also.,B08C2T24WG,1607799838687,5.0
AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,Nice color,This is a good gel polish.  Works well with other gel topcoats and base coats.  Most of the colors were single coat coverage.  A couple of the lighter colors required a second coat.  Set up was quick and no foot or tacky spots after running the UV cycle.  Soaks off well and clean up was as easy as any polish. Loved the variety of colors and overall quality is great.,B08CVCLVS2,1607174175943,5.0
AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,nice set,This is a nice gel set.  Colors are vibrant and the glitter really stands out.  Super easy to use and setup was quick and complete.  Very easy to shape and overall the kit was a pleasure to use.  We even let our 13 year old granddaughter use it as it worked so well and was so easy to use.

AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,better than hot oil,My wife has damaged hair and has used those hot oil treatments.  This works so much better and is not as difficult to use.  After 2 shampooing a and conditionings her hair looks and behaves so much better.  This has repaired the split ends and has tamed the frizzies.

AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,smells nice,"First and foremost- this is a cream deodorant.  If you have never used a cream it is basically rubbing  lotion into your arms pits (anyone remember Tussy deodorant?)  We gave this a go and it smells really nice- a little strong (Jasmine has a very strong sweet scent),  but pleasant.  Did not irritate the skin at all and pretty much stopped odor (we did have a very sweaty 1.5 hour workout and by the end of that we were pretty stinky).  For normal daily use this works just fine and keeps you stink free.  It does leave a bit of a challenge residue on clothes so watch out for sleeveless clothing.",B086MN4SRX,1600292286301,5.0
AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,Great masks,These masks work very good.  Very soothing on the face.  My girls have a beauty day about once a month so we are always trying out new masks.

AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,Love aloe,"I love the way this Aloe works to cure dry skin problems and to soothe any skin irritation.  I use this on burns, and bites, and any other skin issue.  Very soothing and long lasting.  It cures the issue not just covers it up.  Super mild that even my sensitive skin is never irritated.  Smells like aloe and does leave a bit of a tacky- feel (that is what is supposed to do!).  This also works incredible in quickly healing blisters and bringing relief to raw skin.

AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,odd shape,This has an odd shape.  It is almost pointed at the front and kinda like a crown.  It really is slippery and  kept pulling down when used with a mask.  Without the mask it kept riding up and would not stay put.  Very large writing on it made it a bit tacky.  Just didn't work for our needs.,B086YBQ8M7,1596574464089,2.0
AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,A bit large,First this is a real nice pointed top brush.  it is well made and very sorry and consistent.  The handle is also well made and tight to the brush (no wiggle).  Brush cleans up and dries soft and pliable.  It is a #4 size which is on the larger size for a lot of nail art.  This is probably best for solid designs or applying top coats and not for fine detail or complicated designs.  My daughter uses it to apply latex masks and peel off base coats.,B07ZJX5MNJ,1592342692422,4.0
AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,Amazing for mask use,My wife loves this headband.  Her masks hook up easy and this relieves all the ear strain the elastic bands cause.  It is stylish and comfortable.

AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,Excellent bottles,These little spray bottles are awesome.  We filled up a couple with some scented oils and they work perfect.  The bottles are glass and are securely held in the covers.  They do not leak and spray a very fine mist.  The spray is perfect for adding a refreshing scent into a room (or a musty winter weary car interior).  Super easy to fill and the entire package is compact and fits easily into a purse or glovebox.  We also filled one bottle up with a little soapy water to spray on out house plants to take care of the fruit flies that are attracted to the flowers.  Excellent all round spray bottles.,B015A5DGG4,1583066832466,5.0
AHX2B4DEER2QR3IU3CCNB3CWC6TA,Awesome combs,"I love these wooden combs.  They are static free and on a great job of de-tangling the hair.  I have issues with static hair and these have solve the problem with the first use.  I have shorter hair so I don't even bother with a hairbrush anymore.  I really can't evidence which one is my favorite as I tried them all and love them all.  I won't go back to a brush or plastic comb ever again as these work amazing,  Also the finer tooth ones work great on my beard so that's an added bonus!",B081ZN3TD5,1581169846523,5.0

It is not super strong scent, but definitely you can smell it.<br />Second, it does not absorbe fast. I was oily until I fell asleep.<br />It was lightweight.<br />I did felt my skin hidrates the next day, but not quite sure if this is better than other oils that I use.<br />Definitely, I won’t use it, because mainly of the French fries smell.",B00O2FGBJS,1595954861092,2.0

I had to cut a little of them because it was too long for me.<br />The set comes with 2 eye liner, tweezer and 5 pairs of lashes.<br />The liner was easy to apply and then the lashes were stuck on it fast and easy.<br />I went to a barbecue with them and they stay in the entire time.<br />After, they go out without any pain. The eye liner was a little hard to take off. I use my makeup wipes in a hard way. Haha.<br />It did not make my sensitive skin hurt or burn.<br />I love it!",B087GD4BJ1,1593883266584,5.0

Perfect as a gift!<br />It is however, because of the material, like a ceramic or something, very heavy. I think it will not be good as a pret a porter kind of makeup. But perfect for the one you leave on your makeup vanities.<br />The colors are perfect for my skin tone, I’m like a light brown tone. But I’ve found myself using it more as a eye shadow than bronzer.<br />The highlighter gives a pop of glow.<br />No scent on it and it stays perfectly during my days.<br />Like it.

You don't have to constantly change the heads on this.<br /><br />However, when you rotate the heads you have to hold down a button on one side and then use the very small rotater to change heads. It makes it a bit difficult to change the heads.<br /><br />Also, I had problems with it constantly stopping while I was using it. And my calluses aren't even that bad. If you just have a bit of dry skin this will probably work for you, otherwise you're going to want to skip it.",B08BRS98SF,1597044203314,3.0

AECOPBDL3PHOESNB2RXKPZSXGBOA,Downright Impressive!,"I'm super impressed with this fragrance, especially for the insanely reasonable price! I've tried perfumes that cost $150 more than this that I didn't like half as much. The first notes are sweet and bold and then the scent settles down into a nice, deep, sexy fragrance with a bit of a vanilla smell to it, which I absolutely love! My husband also said he really liked it, so that's a win! The only thing I don't love about it is the cheap looking plastic lid on the bottle. It really cheapens the look of the bottle and doesn't snap on well, which is kind of a pain. I thought about just throwing it away, but then if I travel with the bottle I'm afraid it will spray all over my bag. Other than that, I'm a huge fan of this scent and would order this again in a heartbeat. I can't believe that a fragrance that smells this good, in a bottle and package that looks this great is so reasonably priced.",B0BTJ6SYKB,1623097992889,5.0
AECOPBDL3PHOESNB2RXKPZSXGBOA,My 3 Year Old Approves!,"This is a nice set of glittery nail polish. I personally wouldn't wear this on it's own since it's quite sheer, but it's perfect for putting over a color. I ordered this set because my 3 year old LOVES all things sparkly, so it's perfect for kicking solid colors up a notch and making them fabulous enough for a preschooler. It took two coats to get enough sparkles for her taste. It's kind of tricky to get them even, which for makes my inner perfectionist feel a little crazy, but she's 3 and doesn't care. The sparkles are almost holographic so they are intensely sparkly. These nail colors arrive in a nice box with a foam cutout for each bottle. My only complaint about the packaging is that nowhere on the bottles does it say the name of or show the color. There are color dots included if you'd like to make your own color dot for each bottle, but I would much prefer that it arrive with the color on the bottle already so I don't have to. I don't understand why you wouldn't include the color on the bottle. Other than that I'm happy with these.",B08CVCLVS2,1610076149744,4.0

Tipping it over and spilling the soap, leaving globs of it all over the place, it was just pain messy. This dispenser is perfect for her, and everyone really! I was initially pretty frustrated the first time I tried to fill it with regular, thick gel hand soap because it wouldn't work. Then I went back and actually read the directions and found that this only dispenses LIQUID soap and hand sanitizer. It will not work with gels. If you want to use gel hand soap in it you will have to water it down until it's liquid. This dispenser is a sprayer, so it doesn't turn the soap into foam, and it doesn't work with gel soaps or sanitizers. If you're ok with only using liquid products then it works as advertised.",B089YGZZYP,1601000663074,5.0

AECOPBDL3PHOESNB2RXKPZSXGBOA,Where Has This Stuff Been All My Life???,"Oh. My. Word. *Excuse me while I go throw away all my regular nail polish.* This is a Game. Changer. I'm a busy mom and honestly, I just hate going to the nail salon, and who has time to wait for 300 hours (Ok, maybe not quite 300) for your regular nail polish to dry, only to smudge it or have it chip within 2 hours? I had pretty much given up on nail polish and just been resigned to the fact that I would have boring nails forever. This stuff is seriously incredible. You just paint it on, cure it, wipe the top with the cleanser to remove the tacky finish, and VOILA! Perfect nails! I did mine last week with this set and they still look AH-MAZING. When this set arrived, I was a bit bummed to find that there's no color included, just base and top coat. I live an hour from the nearest mall and so I couldn't just pop into the store and get a color, and yet I wanted to try it out... Like, right now. I did some reading and found that you can actually use regular nail polish to make a ""Gel-y"" sandwich. Once you have the base coat on, cure it, then paint your regular color over the top and wait the ""300 hours"" it takes to dry. Then paint the top coat over the regular color, cure, wipe with cleanser and enjoy your stunning, long lasting nails! The only thing I would change about this set is the light. I wound up buying a larger light because the one that comes with this set is quite small and I wanted to be able to fit all my fingers or all my toes in at once. This light is great for storing and being portable, but I personally wanted something bigger. Overall a fantastic set. I'm never going back to regular polish ever again!",B0BC273JJR,1597209932743,5.0

My skin is super smooth for about a week after use. My makeup goes on like butter, and I am convinced my moisturizers and serums also work better on my dermaplaned skin.<br />They are small and precision enough that I can use them around my eyebrows, though I go slow and don't usually use them for that.<br />But for my upper lip, chin, cheeks and forehead I don't know how I got by before these.

AGJWAZESYDYURVDSAMHKVAM2IBWQ,Perfect for travel. Only one heat setting. Long cord.,I ordered this for when I'm traveling and it's perfect for that. This does take longer to use than my full size waver but the size makes this easier to pack and it doesn't take up too much counter space.<br />The curler only has 1 heat setting and that's 410°. That's the temperature I always use on my straightener so I'm fine with not being able to adjust it. It heats up very quickly in about 30 seconds.<br />You use this like a crimper by taking about a 2 inch section of hair and clamping from the top to the bottom.  You can't pull this straight through your hair or it'll just straighten it.,B08NPBQR9L,1610226434922,5.0
AGJWAZESYDYURVDSAMHKVAM2IBWQ,Great for traveling!,You get 5 sets of under eye pads and each one is individually wrapped so you can throw it in your luggage when you travel. You also get 5 facemask which are also individually wrapped. There's a big container of 60 makeup remover wipes and they work really well to remove my makeup.<br />I saw someone say the mask didn't fit them.  My head is pretty small to average size and it fit mine fine. I still had room on the velcro part to make it bigger. The mask fits comfortably and can be refrigerated to help with eye swelling or puffiness.<br />What I liked most about everything is it all says it's not tested on animals and most of it has a cruelty free bunny logo on the back.

AGJWAZESYDYURVDSAMHKVAM2IBWQ,"Nice selection, super easy to use.","I've always struggled with gluing in lashes and I had pretty much given up. I ordered these after a friend was telling me about how great magnetic liner is. I was super impressed with how easy it is for me to put these on.<br />I'm kind of confused on whether the liner is sticky and magnetic or just magnetic. I didn't let it dry all the way before doing my eyebrows and my lower eyelid got stuck to my upper eyelid. I couldn't tell if that was magnet pull or glue.<br />Whatever the liner is, it keeps those lashes in place and they are so easy to put on. The brush is thin but the thicker the line, the better it will hold on to the lashes.<br />My eye lids are sort of small and I think I'm going to have to trim these a tiny bit or the ends can be a little jabby in the corner of my eye.<br />I haven't worn these out yet due to the pandemic but I know the liner lasts because you have to scrub hard to get it off. These should last all day.",B087GD4BJ1,1593288996626,5.0
AFKX24ALWAPX366KX6DWTOBWLQAA,Sold!,"I just recently started using purple shampoo. I have grey hair,  btw. I liked the results I had with another brand so was eager to try this brand. First, at least at the time of this review, the price is decent.<br />The purple shampoo is a deep violet. I applied it to my wet hair and worked it in. Loved the purple lather. Then applied the conditioner which is more of a deep inky blue.  The instructions said to leave it in for a few minutes. When I wash it out, my hair feels differently--it feels as though there's still something there on my hair, but deeply mixed in. It feels differently than when I use regular shampoo.<br />Anyway, I love what this does for my hair. It seems to brighten the light silver and darken the darker grey. At least that's what it seems like. No frizzies either and that's important for me.<br />I used Great Clips brand before trying this, and while I really liked what Great Clips Purple shampoo did for my hair, I prefer this brand.

Makes you look like a ghost appearance wise or someone who is very pale.<br />I left this one for about an hr. It never cracked, but it was there as a very light mask. Easy to wash off. My skin felt very soft afterwards. I was surprised really as I had left it on for so long I'd almost forgotten about it.<br />I feel that the mud mask did have a restorative effect to my skin. It also has a very subtle (and I mean subtle) flower scent. I liked the scent but was happy that it wasn't too strong as I have extremely sensitive facial skin and perfumed skin products make me itch.<br />My skin still feels softer 24 hrs later.",B08CH5PC9W,1606144470654,4.0
AFKX24ALWAPX366KX6DWTOBWLQAA,More vanilla than musk,I liked this shower wash. The liquid is thick and feels rich. It produces a heavy lather.

AFKX24ALWAPX366KX6DWTOBWLQAA,Moisturizes nicely,"This cream is very moisturizing. It feels a bit decadent to be honest. It's a light green and not quite as cucumber-y as I would like. The cucumber smell is there but it's more delicate than another cucumber cream I have on hand.<br />It's silky smooth, goes on easily and is very quickly absorbed. It is pricey, but it makes my skin feel soft and supple.<br />It's especially good on some tough spots--neck and elbows.",B07ZS3DKL5,1597945586405,4.0
AFKX24ALWAPX366KX6DWTOBWLQAA,Great box,"The box is the best thing here. I had high hopes for the mascara. It's string, so it doesn't go on easily. It clumps.

AFKX24ALWAPX366KX6DWTOBWLQAA,A new experience,I've never quite tried anything like this. The cleanser is a light green gel--almost slime but not slimy. Instructions say to apply with wet fingers.<br />At first I used too much as the cleaner went far further than I expected. It has a wonderful light fruit smell and smears easily over the face. I have very sensitive facial skin and this cleaner did not present any problems. It was easy to wash off. My skin felt nice afterwards--not dry at all.,B07ZQRX7FX,1596496891589,4.0
AFKX24ALWAPX366KX6DWTOBWLQAA,Good clay mask,"I liked this clay mask a lot. The mask cream is very thick indeed, and it takes a squeeze to get it out of the tube. It goes a long way, but at the same time, this is a small tube (3 oz). It dries quickly. And it's the type of mask that makes your face feel TIGHT. The type where you can't smile.<br />After about 20 mins, I washed this off. It was easy to remove. After using a few times, I think it does indeed have a brightening effect on the skin. It doesn't moisturize. At least it didn't for me, and I had to lather on cream afterwards as my skin felt a bit dry after the mask.<br />Overall I liked this. I like how it worked but it is on the pricey side.",B07M9D3WYW,1596398540944,4.0
AFKX24ALWAPX366KX6DWTOBWLQAA,Nifty idea but I'd worry about it holding mask in place,"What's that saying about necessity being the mother of invention? Well here we are in a pandemic wearing face masks. Someone came up with the idea of a head band with buttons to hold the mask mask in place.<br /><br />This is a thin material. Think very thin t shirt type material. The headband measures about 18 inches and just over 3 inches wide. I like the material for a headband. However, its use as a mask holder is iffy. Many people complain that the elastic that holds the masks in place makes their ears pop out. That is definitely true of some masks. They can also be wearying on the ears, having that elastic against your ears all day, so this headband is a great concept.<br />I put the headband on and as I stretched it over my head, I heard a pop, so some stitching gave somewhere.<br /><br />I attached two types of masks, one at a time. First, it was a bit fiddly to get the elastic over the button. Once it just sprang off.<br /><br />One mask using the buttons fit well. Another did not. The latter mask opened up on the sides.<br /><br />I would hesitate to wear this out thinking that everything would stay put for hours. I like the headband as a headband. It's nice material. A sort of light grey merle, but if you are looking at this for long-term safety, I would say no.",B088FBNQXW,1594835672084,2.0

And used the white (which is the mostly iridescent  one) on my four year yeah old over her eye shadow for Halloween as well. It just was absolutely stunning!

AEUAQ6BAUEBP2C754LR3ILYHP54Q,OK,"I tried this on thick curly 3c hair. The results were quite decent. You first wash your hair with the pre-treatment shampoo to clarify the hair and remove dirt and oils. At this point, make sure to detangle the hair well and section it into smaller parts so that you can apply the keratin treatment. The hair should be 80% towel dried. You then comb in the keratin treatment to each section of hair. I recommend wearing gloves. Allow it time to process and then blow dry and finish with a flat iron. The hair came out quite silky and smooth, but it began to revert into fluffiness as the day went on. Adding a bit of hair oil helped to restrain the humidity. For an at home kit, it is decent, but it is not as strong as salon treatments.",B07SLFWZKN,1619485994612,4.0
AEUAQ6BAUEBP2C754LR3ILYHP54Q,Great,I was surprised that this set left my hair nice and soft. It cleansed my hair hair very well and got rid of any residue. The smell is also nice. The shampoo and conditioner was a great combo and left my hair feeling clean and soft.,B08XJWLLKQ,1619484702771,5.0

AHBDPVXHGNIRMIGLCRCABCOLFJTA,Wow. This is really nice stuff.,"Two things drew me to ordering this product. The rose scent and the name ""Manilla."" I assumed it was made in the Philippines, and I'm half Filipino. To my surprise, it's made in Lithuania! It is, however, really quite nice. It's a moisturizer with a scent - not something too often seen these days - but the primary aroma is definitely rose. And I just can't resist that. The scent doesn't linger and follow you around. I really only noticed it until after the cream had been absorbed. The cream itself is very sheer and feels lovely going on. It's absorbed quickly and leaves no greasy residue behind. My skin is quite sensitive and I've experienced no breakout issues. All in all, using this product has been a genuine pleasure, both tactile and sensory. I really just enjoy using it, and my skin feels soft and moist, even in our dry winter air. I can recommend this product with enthusiasm!",B08C71WBLC,1611957762049,5.0
AHBDPVXHGNIRMIGLCRCABCOLFJTA,My new favorite thing! I'm obsessed with it.,"This is really wonderful stuff. The application directions are unusual. Following them, I put four drops (that's what works for me) in my palm, then rub my palms together until they feel warm. Then I pat my face with them, applying the serum all over. I spread it gently afterwards to make sure I haven't missed any areas. The solution is very quickly absorbed and leaves my skin feeling as soft as a baby's bottom, as the old expression says. I'm mean it's reeeealy soft, and not oily or greasy at all. It's AMAZING. What really has me addicted is the smell. It's not floral or citrus, or really like anything I can put my finger on. If I had to, I'd say it's faintly sweet… possibly herbal? Well, whatever it is, it's intoxicating to me. It lingers just a while after the serum dries and I thoroughly enjoy it. I'd wear this scent as a perfume if it were available. It's not strong or offensive; it's just unique and pleasant. I recommend this with enthusiasm!!",B07NPCT6L5,1607704149561,5.0
AHBDPVXHGNIRMIGLCRCABCOLFJTA,Better than the loofa one I have.,"I recently started using one of these with loofa on it. It works for me, even if loofa does take a while to break in. However, it also absorbs quite a bit of soap. I like this one much better.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to order it. How would silicone feel against my back? It turns out that it feels fine and works well. I like that it needs much less soap since it doesn't absorb it. Instead of spreading it all over the thing - I like the side with little bristles like a brush - all you need is to put some in the center. Moving the brush over your back spreads the soap out nicely and does the job without a lot of waste. It squeaks a bit on un-soaped skin, but that's pretty easy to get over and doesn't last long. It was just a surprise, initially. It feels like a gentle scrub, and that's the important part. It also rinses off easily and dries quickly, an important point here in our humid climate. The interior relative humidity in our house hovers around 55% in the summer, so things can get moldy fast. That's what usually happens if a loofa or any other kind of absorbent surface isn't dried properly. I just hang this up on the thoughtfully provided suction hooks and forget about it. It's great, and I'm really glad I gave this a try!",B08FD2KP9R,1599144493171,5.0
AHBDPVXHGNIRMIGLCRCABCOLFJTA,"Large, stiff, awkward to hold and overstuffed.","I know that loofahs take a while to break in, but I think this product has other issues. I'm a woman with smaller hands. This is just too oversized for me. It's difficult to hold and control. It's also overstuffed with a very convex surface, so only the center of the raised area actually touches my body. It doesn't mold itself to the surface of my skin, so I feel like I'm scrubbing in thin lines, and it doesn't really do the job in the dips and grooves a human body has because of that. It does dries quickly, even though I don't have anything to hang it off of. I'm pretty disappointed with this order and I can't recommend this product.",B08B5FJMHM,1598622810104,2.0
AHBDPVXHGNIRMIGLCRCABCOLFJTA,Quite happy with this! A great find.,"I had some reservations... I’ve seen the round wood ones around, but never made the leap. I was afraid the ceramic would make this too heavy and bulky, but it does not. It’s quite lightweight and because it’s vertical, saves some space. It comes with extensive directions - a nice change - but is really very easy to use and set up. It’s very hot and humid where I live, so I was also worried that adding more humidity to the air would be a bad thing, however, the air that comes out is quite cool, which seems to cool down the area around it (and by “it”, I mean me). I found it very comfortable.<br /><br />I wasn’t sure how I felt about the colored lights option, but I love it! You can choose red, or a brighter red, and also green and a soft lavender blue with their corresponding brighter shades. You can choose to have your color, or opt to have the unit cycle through them all. It’s quite restful. You can, of course, just use the white light. You can set the steam for a continuous output or intermittent.<br /><br />The until must be cleaned after 10 hours of use. It doesn’t hold a great deal of water, so I was wondering if that was going to be inconvenient. I ran it for two continuous hours and I could tell that filling the tank twice would be about 10 hours. So THAT’S easy to keep track of!<br /><br />All in all, I couldn’t be happier with this unit! It checks all the boxes and I can enjoy my essential oils in an peaceful, comforting environment. Highly recommended!!",B07T3Z58HL,1564775230507,5.0

These are wonderful handmade bars of soap but the do fall apart quickly which is why the inside of the package was so hazy. They are gentle and smell lovely of cinnamon. They are not super strongly scented and the scent doesn't last on your skin that long. Sweet almond has no scent unless almond is added to it, I didn't really pay attention to the details when ordering and assumed it would be scented like other sweet almond products I have - but I love this.

It glides and rolls smoothly. The microneedling treatment is not too painful when you simply apply a little bit of pressure. It did not cause bleeding because I used it gently as directed.

Keep in mind this does not have anti-perspirant in it so it will allow you to sweat. However, it should help prevent odor.

AH5ONINJRNZ674DXUMV4RMYIFYVQ,Very moisturizing and soften skins,"This Derma Clear B5 Cica Cream is not oily/greasy at all. It makes my skin feel incredibly hydrating and makes my skin so very soft. It’s unclear from the packaging if this product is specifically designed to use on your face or all over. I’ve used it on my hands, elbows, and on dry spots all over my body and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. I didn’t notice any scent when using the lotion. My only reason for taking a star away from the rating is because of the cost of this product. You only get 1.69 fluid ounces of product, so it’s not a great value. However, I do think the product is effective!",B0859CYSTM,1593192215458,4.0

No big lift or length, but it still adds more than what my middle aged lashes have on their own. Overdone lashes would look silly on me anyway. This provides a natural look.

AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,"Unscented, Seems Decent, Not 100% Sure About Ingredients","I looked up the ingredients for this product at the Environmental Working Groups (EWG) Skin Deep data base & the following ingredients either rated as not green or I couldn't find them (0=green or safe, 10=red or dangerous):<br /><br />CYCLOPENTASILOXANE (3) - Persistent, bioaccumulative in wildlife, classified as expected to be toxic or harmful, uterine tumors in female rats, increased anogenital distance observed in rats at a moderate dose, moderate dose in rate suggested dopamine D2-receptor behavior on pituitary cells, suspected to be an environmental toxin and be persistent or bioaccumulative.<br />POLYSORBATE-60 (3)<br />DIPEPTIDE-3 AMINOHEXANOATE - Can't find this ingredient on EWG.<br />ACETYL ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN - Can't find this ingredient on EWG.<br /><br />I looked up DIPEPTIDE-3 AMINOHEXANOATE on DuckDuckGo & I guess it's a new skin ingredient. It might be why it & ACETYL ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN are not on EWG as they haven't been evaluated for safety. I really don't know though, it's just speculation on my part. As for safety, who knows? I rely on EWG to let me know. This is frustrating.<br /><br />I've used this several evenings as a night cream & I like it, but I don't love it. I heat my home exclusively with a wood stove. Even running humidifiers & essential oil diffusers 24/7, the air is painfully dry. So far this cream seems pretty good on my middle aged skin. The funny thing is, out of all the various brands I've tried on my face, a little known handmade brand has by far served me best. It's a brand called Eruzile or Progress in Health. They have two names. I don't know why. It's really annoying. They are on Etsy & last I checked, have their own website but for some foolish reason, it seems to be more expensive to shop at their website. And to be clear, I am not affiliated with them, I'm just a long time customer. Another brand I like but it is ridiculously expensive, so I hardly ever buy it is Juice Beauty Stem Cellular. You can get it right here on amazon.<br /><br />Okay, back to this brand. It is a light/thin feeling cream. Not greasy. It seems to absorb well. My skin does feel a tiny bit tight when I get up in the morning. I find a few spritz with rose water helps. This is packaged in a glass pot that you use your fingers to apply. A little plastic in the lid, so not Zero Waste, but not bad. It is not scented. It does have a smell as is normal because the ingredients will have their own smell to them, but when applying I don't notice the smell, so calling it unscented or fragrance free is more than reasonable. I only notice its smell if I'm practically sticking my nose in the pot & inhaling deeply.<br /><br />For me, this isn't moisturizing enough for the dead of winter, but for spring & fall I expect it will serve me fine.<br /><br />Overall, I would have rated this higher if not for the ingredient concerns.",B07W1WJZFG,1612028329379,3.0
AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,"Pretty Set, One Brush Frayed After First Use, The Rest Are Holding Up Well","I ordered this in the #6 set to use for watercolors. I know these are nail brushes, but I have found some nail brush products to not only be prettier in the hand, but also to last longer than standard watercolor brushes so I will order brushes like this on occasion.<br /><br />This set has it's pros & cons. The blue colored brush has a very disappointing brush head. After only one use the bristles started to fray.  The amber colored detail brush works great with no issues, same with the pink colored blunt brush. None of the heads are particularly large. The light blue is nice for little details.<br /><br />Knowing that watercolor is much more gentle to use, the fact that one of these brushes frays makes me wonder how well they will hold up to much more rough chemical nail use. Something you might want to keep in mind when considering your brush options.<br /><br />The overall look of the brushes is very nice. I love all things girly & nail brushes rarely fail me in the girly options that are floating around on amazon.<br /><br />So far my absolute favorite nail brush (that I use for watercolor) is a 100% Kolinsky Sable Round Nail Brush.

I make up my batch & mix some of this into part of the batter to do a layered swirl mix as to not over power the soap & make it too gritty. The bars look great & smell great, plus there is the natural exfoliation which is wonderful for the hands as well as the body.<br /><br />I personally love this as a kitchen hand soap because it really helps to remove cooking smells from the skin.

AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,"So Far, So Good","These have been working well so far. I mainly ordered them to scrub my face so my tinted moisturizer goes on more smoothly. I have combination skin that has both black & white heads plus dry skin. When I ordered these, I expected them to be half the size. So for my intended purpose, they are a bit of overkill. Once they are fully wet, they get a lot thicker & fluffier. In order to get my nose properly scrubbed, I bend the loofah & use the bent edge. It works.<br /><br />I hang these to dry on a copper rod that is just small enough to accommodate the little hanging loop that these have on them. This then hangs in front of a window which gets a lot of sun. It's a great way to get them to dry & to help fight bacteria.<br /><br />I hope they are 100% natural. I read in one of the questions that it has a foam core. I'm not too sure what to think of that. Really, with all the Chinglish & poor spelling, what should one think aside from, ""Oh, it's yet another made in China item being sold on amazon."" For the record, these loofah's will not ""remove horniness"" OMG, they really need to get someone to clean up their listings LOL!<br /><br />Overall, I'm really surprised by the quality & the size of these esp. after the lack of quality control in the listing.

AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,Beautiful Upgrade for DIY from Polluting Plastic Bottles,"This is the second set of spray bottles of this type that I have ordered. Each set has been from a different brand/seller. They both perform exactly the same. I use them to make my own household cleaners, room sprays, toilet sprays, etc. I'm not a fan of our cultures plastic addiction & try to reduce my impact on the planet when I can. Running my own eco family farm full time helps considerably ;)<br /><br />I like everything about these bottles except for the same exact thing I don't like about my other set of bottles, the spray head rotates easily. It doesn't unscrew, that's not what I'm talking about. It's the spray head itself. I think if the bottle wasn't so heavy this wouldn't be an issue, but when spraying downward, the bottle will move due to the weight. If I hold the bottle with one hand, while spraying with the other, all is well.<br /><br />A possible solution to this might be to purchase these 16 oz amber glass bottles separately, then purchase a separate pack of very highly rated, top quality spray nozzles & a sheet of labels to see if that helps. Perhaps these sets are being sold with lower quality spray nozzles. I really cannot say. I currently don't have a need to order a bunch of bottles in this size & enjoy the convenience of having a ready made kit of 2, so for now, I'm happy enough with what I have.",B089CSF11Y,1598199782505,5.0

While this is a nice brush, Bass Brush is still the winner (link: https://amzn.to/2Y72DVJ)<br />The comb that comes with this is plastic. Not my thing at all.

Obviously the brushes wont last as long, but right now, I'm not using them, LOL! I just wanted them, because you know, Harry Potter & therefore I had to have them.

Organic Wear provides a very thin, light coverage that requires a little bit of pressed powder to tone down the shine.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I decided to try this.

Otherwise they are great. I love the variety of prints, they are comfortable, & look good.<br />If it helps, I have long straight hair that goes past my bra line. I don't have bangs.

Pros:  they stay in place without slipping or dripping, even while I move around; within an hour of use my skin feels more moisturized,; after several uses my skin looks more plumped; non-irritating and scent free; they cover my entire face; and of course, at about $1 each, the price is great!  Cons:  the masks are folded with a backing sheet but are still trickier than most to unfold; the eye holes are a little small; and my skin feels sticky after I remove the masks and pat in the remaining serum, so I have to splash cool water to get my skin feeling clean.

One of the main reasons I ordered this was because I expected a pleasant scent, so this was disappointing.  The mud is very thin and a little watery which was surprising.  Ultimately the mud doesn’t fully dry or pull my skin, and it’s pretty easy to wash off...no dried mud on my hairline!  There are little bits of something in the mud, leaves I think, that I don’t care for.  They’re aren’t a lot of them, so it seems like this wasn’t intentional and may be a quality control issue.  Up close the bits look a little rotten and rather unappealing.  After 15 minutes my pores look a little tighter, the few tiny blackheads I have are still there, and I can’t really say my skin feels more hydrated.  It doesn’t feel dry, it pretty much feels like it always does.  The packaging, as with all Freshme products is lovely, with the tube of mud packaged inside a matching box, so very giftable.  Personally, I prefer the Freshme sheet masks to this mud.  The clarifying benefits I expect from a mud mask just aren’t as obvious as I’d hoped.",B08CH5PC9W,1605840100014,3.0
AGSVNZDZNPCMXG5DEFXMZNRH2LCQ,"Nice masks, nice results!","I’ve tried several different Karuna masks...they’re all good, but some are better than others.  This particular set is a great mix of masks designed to help with different needs, including hydrating, soothing and brightening.  The masks are individually wrapped and presented in a box that opens like a book, with suggestions for which masks to use on which days.  The packaging is nice and these would make a great gift.  The masks are very saturated (overly saturated, IMO) with serum, with plenty left over to use on my neck.  They’re large enough to easily cover my entire face, and come with a paper backing that makes them easy to to unfold.  Because they’re so saturated they easily slip while on my face, which makes it impossible to do anything other than sit still for the 20-30 minutes I wear them.  Also, there’s so much serum left on my face after I remove the masks, it’s impossible for my skin to absorb it all.  I’ve discovered that lightly splashing my face with cold water helps remove the excess serum and my skin fully dries more quickly.  Ultimately, all of the face masks left my skin very soft and hydrated, and a few of them plumped my skin and created a lovely even skin tone.  There is one set of eye masks in the kit and that that were surprisingly light and effective, reducing puffiness and brightening my eyes.

Oddly, I don’t really notice the smell in the shower.  I love the exfoliation and use it on my entire body.  Out of the shower, I feel a mild oil barrier on my skin that I don’t care for.  Once I add my normal body shaping cream (Clarins Body Fit), I’m in heaven!  The 2 products together leave my skin super cool and tingly for about an hour, followed by crazy soft skin.  I don’t actually have a lot of cellulite (thank you Clarins!), but what I do have is less noticeable after just 2 uses.  So, what’s not to like?  This scrub is so incredibly messy, it’s borderline impractical!  Most scrubs are made with sugar or salt crystals held together with some form of oil or gel, and dissolve in the shower.  Ground coffee doesn’t dissolve and this scrub is dry, so it literally gets everywhere...like sand from the beach!  And worse, I have a walk in shower with white tile floors...coffee stains if it sits too long!  As much as I like the way this product smells and improves my skin texture, it’s a pain in my cellulite free backside to clean up!  Mixing it with a little water and creating a paste before use helps a little, and thankfully I have a handheld shower to quickly rinse it off my tiled walls and shower door, but I’m constantly concerned it’s going to stain my floor grout.

The mask was super saturated out of the package, so I had to scrape some of the serum off to keep it from dripping.  I also had to fold the large mask over in a few spots where it covered my hairline on all 3 sides.  On my face the mask was cool and refreshing.  Conveniently, it didn’t slip at all, even while sitting up and looking at my cell phone.  I could smell the green tea, but it wasn’t overwhelming.  TIP:  I’ve learned that Karuna masks leave A LOT of serum on the face that doesn’t easily absorb into the skin once the mask is removed.  I left the mask on for 30 minutes, increasing absorption and letting it dry out a bit...I highly recommend this, followed by splashing cool water on your face to gently remove any excess serum.  This prevents sticky skin and left my face feeling smooth and soft almost immediately.  Within 2 hours my skin felt hydrated and looked brighter and super clean.

I welcomed the opportunity to try this assortment.<br /><br />I found the bubble bath to be a good product for my household. Lots of bubbles, no scent that I could detect and an easy to use dispenser. The body wash/shampoo is fine as a body wash and I love the foam dispenser. It works ok for an infant as shampoo but I don’t like it as shampoo for a toddler with more hair. The wipes are great and I like the small package so they stay moist longer. The lotion is quite thin as most baby lotion is so you have to be careful when opening or dispensing it because you can find yourself with way more than you wanted very quickly. I also could not discern any scent on the lotion. The oil I only use to pour just a tad into a bath so soften and moisten the skin.

I attempted that with this conditioner and found that not only did the conditioner not do any untangling, but I got the brush stuck in my hair! I then rinsed and rinsed to get it all out and then tackled the knotted hair. My hair acted as if I had not had any conditioner at all and I had to fight my way through the knots. Once dry, my hair felt normal.<br /><br />I have ceased using the conditioner but I do like the affect of the purple shampoo on my salt and pepper hair.",B08QKXY1KN,1623276456190,3.0

After using both items, may hair is silky smooth and easy to style. It does not feel heavy or oily.<br /><br />The shampoo smells nice and lathers well. It also rinses out easily. The conditioner smells even better and makes a big difference how easy it is to comb through my wet hair.

It cleans and exfoliates while it also hydrates my skin. When I get out of the tub or shower I don’t have to apply lotion to my body because the scrub left my skin completely moisturized.<br /><br />The sugar in this product does the job of exfoliating and making the skin fresh and new. The oil in the product does the moisturizing, much better than just a lotion after because it really coats the skin.<br /><br />There will be some residue left in the tub or shower that has to be rinsed with really hot water when done or it will be slippery for the next shower or bath.<br /><br />Definitely a recommend for anyone that understands what this product is.",B07FPS2VFK,1619392919311,5.0

It does include 6 beautiful colors and a gel polish that is just the right consistency to apply evenly and yet get decent coverage. The gels cure in 60 seconds. I found two coats to be adequate or 1 coat and glitter on top.<br /><br />An irritant is the lack of either a dot of the color on top of the bottle or a set of stickers to create my own.,B08P15TB2V,1614212687891,4.0

AHGQDSOBAIVAAKJFIVEGS344MSXA,Great for moisturizing during the winter months,"My oils arrived in bottles with security seals beneath the lids. Each bottle has a cap but a pump accompanies each bottle as well. I much prefer the pumps for oils since they are thinner and it can be difficult to control a pour. During the winter months I use these oils as skin moisturizers. When still damp from a shower, I rub the oil on my skin and it moisturizes much better than any type of lotion that I have tried.<br /><br />These oils also make wonderful body scrubs using essential oils for scent and sugar or salt for the exfoliating. Using the scrubs also helps to moisturize.<br /><br />I found the oils to be fresh, no sign of a rancid smell. They both come in an amber colored bottle which is the best way to store them.<br /><br />Just in case you are not familiar with these types of oils, they are not scented. Neither oil has any type of scent at all and they are meant to be used as moisturizing products or carrier oils.<br /><br />Overall: really nice set of oils that are fresh and in the right type of bottle.",B08LYT4Q2X,1605736873530,5.0

If you have never used good scissors, you may not know that these are poor quality and won’t do a good job on anyone’s hair.<br /><br />I was actually disappointed in the cape as I expected it to be a bit better than it is. It is poorly designed and doesn’t quite cover the entire area where hair would fall on your neck. The combs are OK and so are the clips.

AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,"Easy & Painless, Temporary Smoothing w/ Serum-Enjoy It But Can’t Gauge Long Term Benefit","﻿I’ve been using the NIRA Skincare Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a couple weeks and can’t yet gauge whether the laser is effective at increasing collagen production and smoothing wrinkles as a long term benefit. I get good results from the hyaluronic acid (HA) serum as it gives quick but temporary plumping and smoothing of wrinkles, as do other good HA serums. I also suspect the warmth created by Nira laser may increase absorption of the HA serum and boost its short term benefits (though I can’t say for sure).<br /><br />I assume it will take regular use for at least 60 days (and likely 90 days) to judge Nira‘s benefits beyond the temporary HA plumping. Nira’s own before and after photos are from the 90-day mark. While I’ll continue use of the Nira laser to see if it helps, I question the extent of any long term benefits based on Nira’s own photos that show a smiling before photo and a rather solemn after photo; clearly, we more lines are evident when smiling so I feel photos would be more credible if they showed someone with the same or similar expression in the before and after photos.<br /><br />Still, I like the Nira laser as it holds a charge well and is quick and easy to use. It gives feedback via beeps. Nira states it has FDA clearance (which I haven’t verified) for wrinkle treatment around the eyes. I’m cautious about the eye area, so I’m initially trying Nira on less sensitive skin between my eyebrows where I have fine lines and slight sagging and also on my neck where I have a weird wrinkle likely from looking down at my tablet. I started using Nira on fine lines around my mouth, but I may hold off until I feel confident it won’t exacerbate existing pigmentation issues.<br /><br />Nira is painless and I only feel warming on setting 2 or 3 (depending on area). The skin around my mouth is drier and only tolerates a 2, and it turns red temporarily. I’ve tried a 4 between the eyebrows and it stings, so I’ll need to work up. I use the HA serum after use, and it’s a clear gel like serum that’s calming and my redness goes away quickly. I get a quick plumping effect that temporarily helps smooths lines, but I can’t say if Nira will provide a long term benefit over time. I do like using it with the serum, so I’m rating it 4 stars. I’ll update as appropriate.",B08P2DZB4X,1623685953622,4.0
AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,Perfect For Dry & Sensitive Skin▪️Rich & Heavy But Not Greasy Or Uncomfortable▪️Subtle Fragrance,"﻿Ogana Cell Bio Actiome Recovery Cream is a wonderful cream for my dry, sensitive skin. This is a thick, heavy, white cream with very subtle fragrance (last ingredient). This cream feels rich, but my dry skin doesn’t look greasy and my skin is dry enough that I’ve used this during the day. Still, it’s heavy and I prefer it as a night cream. It makes my skin feel calm, supple and so hydrated that it minimizes my fine lines.<br /><br />When I first applied this cream, it felt kind of like a barrier cream. While I love rich creams, I dislike creams that sit heavy on top of my skin as it feels annoying to me like my skin can’t breathe. But this Ogana Cell cream feels good as it turns out it absorbs well and feels like it only leaves just a light, protective layer that’s breathable on my skin. It’s probably just the feel of the occlusive dimethicone. This cream feels good and isn’t too heavy for me.<br /><br />This cream is perfect for times my face gets irritated or agitated as it feels extra gentle and calming. I also used a little of this cream on the back of my hands when they feel dry and get red as this cream is soothing and makes them feel better. This cream has no alcohol and the ingredients rate low risk by EWG, except fragrance always get a high risk rating. Love it. 5 stars. Made in Korea.",B08QVJ4NVD,1620433133456,5.0
AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,"Skin Feels Soft & Fairly Comfortable, No Greasy Residue-Moderately Strong Perfume & TEA (3.5 Stars)","Spanature Olive Hand & Body Lotion comes with 4 travel size lotions (individually boxed for gifting) in a 2.53 oz size that’s more than twice the size of the tiny 1 oz hand creams I usually buy for my purse. I go through lotion and cream fast as I use it every time I wash my hands and more, so I like this bigger size as it lasts longer but is still a compact size for my purse. It’s also big enough for a long weekend away from home.<br /><br />This is a lightweight mineral oil based lotion that absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave any greasy residue. It has a pleasant feel and adds just enough moisture to make my dry hands soft and fairly comfortable. I do prefer more hydration, but I also have dry rather than normal skin. The fragrance is moderately strong and sweet. It’s okay used just on my hands, but it would be too strong for me if used as an all over body lotion.<br /><br />I dislike that this lotion has controversial Triethanolamine (TEA). The FDA designates it as safe for limited use (but bans it from hand sanitizer), but EWG rates it as a moderate health risk (allergen). And TEA can play a role in the formation of dangerous nitrosamines when combined with certain preservatives. I can’t assess that issue in this or any specific products, so I just try to avoid TEA. That aside, I like this lotion pretty well for limited use. 3.5 Stars.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, Mineral Oil, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Stearate, Stearic Acid, Olea Europaea (Olive), Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Trideceth-6, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Disodium EDTA, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Fragrance.",B01M24DUXH,1620149359950,4.0
AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,"NonGreasy Fragrance Free Oil▪️Dry Skin Gets Hydration Boost, Feels Silky Soft & Firmer▪️Low Risk","This Beauty Stat Universal Moisture Essence is 100% Squalane from plant sugar. This is a clear, fragrance free liquid in a dropper bottle. Its non greasy, feels weightless and is non irritating to my sensitive skin. It can be applies directly to the skin, but my favorite way to use it is to add a couple drops to my face cream (and still use a serum). I’ve used it with Beauty Stat Moisture Boost Cream, but it also works great with other face creams. I even add it to my creams that fall just short of hydrating my skin enough and feel like the I get enough moisture once this squalane is added.<br /><br />I love the results of this squalane Essence as I notice it gives my skin an immediate moisture boost that minimizes my fine lines, and it also makes my dry skin feel silky soft. I’ve been using Beauty Stat squalane well over a month as this is my second bottle (finished a travel size first), and my skin looks and feels firmer too. Squalane is also anti aging as it has antioxidants that fight free radicals and skin damage. This Beauty Stat squalane is excellent for my dry, sensitive skin and squalane gets a low risk EWG rating.

AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,"Real Benefits-Fades Dark Spots, Helps Even Skin Tone, Softer & Firmer Skin, Lasting Hydration","This Beauty Stat Universal Essentials kit includes generous mini sizes of the Universal C Skin Refiner Serum with 20% L-Ascorbic Acid, Universal Moisture Essence (100% Squalane from sugar) and Universal Moisture Boost Cream. These fragrance free products are exceptional for my hyperpigmentation and skin tone issues, dry skin and skin texture. These don’t irritate my dry and sensitive skin and seem well suited to any skin types.<br /><br />I’ve used 20% L-Ascorbic acid for many years and worked up from 5% to 20% over time as it can sting, itch or irritate the skin to go straight to a high 20% concentration. I’ve been using this Universal C Serum since last year (before this sample kit) and had no stinging this time and had only temporary, slight stinging when I first tried the C serum last year as I wasn’t using my Vitamin C serum as routinely for a short period.<br /><br />With regular use at least 1x a day, the Universal C Serum brightens my skin and evens my skin tone. While it didn’t go away 100%, this serum flattened and faded a large brown spot on my jawline so much it became barely visible. It also faded smaller brown spots on my cheeks. The serum makes my skin smoother and it seems a bit firmer. Vitamin C is an excellent antioxidant for long term anti aging benefits too.<br /><br />I apply the Universal C Serum after cleansing and toning and follow with the Essence (Squalene drops) and Moisture Boost. The Moisture Boost feels lightweight and nongreasy, but it’s super moisturizing when I mix in a couple Squalane drops. The texture of my dry skin feels so silky and smooth, and my skin feels comfortable and amply hydrated all day. These products provide real benefits for me.

AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,"Feels Lightweight For My Dry Skin, Better For Evening As Strong Lavender Scent & Retinyl Palmitate","This Kneipp lavender lotion is thick, but it’s not a heavy or greasy lotion. This probably provides moderate hydration for normal skin, but for me it feels quite lightweight. I think it’s a nice cream, but I prefer a richer lotion or cream that comforts my dry skin more and provides longer lasting hydration. When I’ve applied this after an evening shower, my skin feels reasonably moisturized for a few hours but it’s not enough moisture to last all night so I need to reapply before bed. This seems best for those who don’t need heavy hydration and enjoy a lavender scent.<br /><br />This lotion does have a moderately strong lavender scent that even lingers on my hands after washing. It smells nice and doesn’t bother me, but it may bother those sensitive to fragrance as this is just in the range of what I can tolerate as strong lavender has been a headache trigger for me.

AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,"Minty & Cooling, Heavy & Doesn’t Absorb Well, Agitates My Sensitive Skin-Some Good Ingredients","﻿I’m in my 50’s and have dry, sensitive skin and also have some contact allergies. This Murad Hydration Intense Recovery Cream is pale green and has a nice, light spearmint scent that may be from mint oils, such as Mentha Viridis Leaf Oil and Mentha Arvensis Leaf Oil, as chemical fragrance isn’t listed. This cream has an unusual balmy texture that feels slippery and silky. It oddly feels like it just sits on top of my dry skin rather being absorbed. It’s not greasy, but it feels heavy like a barrier cream. I’m not crazy about that feel. I do like that it’s thick and has somewhat of a firming feel.<br /><br />I’d be okay with the texture at night (not for daytime), but this cream imparts a strong cooling sensation (possibly from mint oil as this is alcohol free) that doesn’t feel pleasing to me. Instead of feeling soothing and calming, it feels stimulating and kind of agitating. My skin gets itchy and prickly, so I’ve had to wash it off as my skin feels uncomfortable and like it might blister or get a rash (though it hasn’t in the short time I’ve left it on). It feels better rubbed on my arm, so maybe it’s good for other skin types.<br /><br />I can’t gauge how well this hydrates as I had to discontinue use. It has some good stuff like apple fruit extract (scavenges free radicals) and algae (antioxidant and hydration). It also has moisturizing and/or soothing ingredients, such as glycerin, vitamin E, butylene glycol, macadamia nut oil and shea butter. However, it also has known sensitizers, such as spearmint and mint oils, that get “poor” ratings by Paula’s Choice. This generally seems like a quality cream, but it feels heavy and irritating to my sensitive skin. 3.5 stars.",B08SQZ1B3W,1613774659440,3.0

My favorite gels are by Patchology as I get amazing results. The GenSkin marine algae gels seem good quality and they do make my skin feel soft, but I don’t see the obvious plumping benefits I get with the Patchology gels and these gels also don’t feel as comforting or refreshing. I’ve even compared by wearing one of each brand at the same time, and my skin with the Patchology gel gets superior results as my lines barely show.<br /><br />These GenSkin gels are deep blue and have added colorant (which is typical). They also have fragrance, but it doesn’t smell overly strong. The GenSkin patches stay on well and have some good dry skin ingredients, such as sodium hyaluronate, glycerin, beta glucan, matricaria flower extract and butylene glycol. Most ingredients rate low risk by EWG (other than fragrance, colorant and preservative). These seem good, but I just don’t get the comfort or obvious plumping and hydration I get with Patchology gels. So these are just okay for me. 3 stars. Made in China.",B08KWN77LW,1610004162259,3.0

It feels so gentle and comfortable on my skin. This wash leaves my skin calm and isn’t drying at all. Even without sulfates, it produces ample lather when used on a pouf or mitt. This wash feels refreshing and has a subtle and fresh mango scent that’s natural from mango fruit extract rather than from chemical fragrance.<br /><br />The ingredients are outstanding in that all rate low risk by EWG (all get a 1 rating except citric acid gets a 2).

I’m pleased that Follain feels gentle, and I can use it without any issues. It’s a plain looking white bar that lathers well and feels pleasing as a daily body soap in the shower. This Follain soap cleanses well, and it’s generous lather is perfect to use on my legs and under my arms for shaving.<br /><br />This soap hasn’t made my skin dry, itchy or irritated. I follow my shower with my usual moisturizer, and my skin feels calm and comfortable. This soap bar seems long lasting, maybe because it doesn’t get mushy or disintegrate.

I apply 3 drops to my skin after cleansing and follow with my face cream after giving the oil a little time to absorb. This oil feels rich, but it doesn’t have a heavy or greasy feeling on my skin. It makes my skin feel great whether I apply my face cream after waiting for the oil to absorb fully or I apply it while there’s still a light residue on my face.<br /><br />I can use Laloirelle during the day without issues applying makeup after, but others may have a different experience as I have dry skin. But I do prefer it at night with a face cream after as it’s so effective and long lasting that my skin still feels well moisturized and smooth when I wake the next morning. The oily residue is gone by then, but I think my fine lines look softer and my skin looks more radiant. I feel like my skin gets a boost or head start for the day, and that it’s not just a temporary effect from silicones and chemicals found in so many products.<br /><br />This contains a sandalwood and jasmine oil blend that’s so light I don’t even smell it when I apply the product to my face. This oil feels super gentle and nonirritating to my sensitive skin. This has dry skin ingredients (e.g., avocado oil, evening primrose oil & Vitamin E) and anti aging ingredients (e.g., ginseng root, shiitake mushroom, etc.) This oil uses 98% organic ingredients, and all ingredients rate low risk to health per Skincarisma (using EWG standards).

It feels light, absorbs quickly and moisturizes my skin fairly well. This lotion leaves my hands and skin soft, silky and comfortable. I don’t feel my dry skin gets as much hydration as I get with my favorite premium body butters and creams, but those are heavier products so I don’t expect as much from a lotion.<br /><br />When applied after my shower, I get about 8 hours of hydration. That’s pretty good, though not the 24 hours claimed on the site. I do have dry skin and find this lotion hydrates better than most lotions. I’ve occasionally found one that gives me longer lasting hydration, but it’s uncommon. Excipial keeps my dry skin comfortable and itch free more like 12 hours but has chemicals such as parabens, while Guayaquil Hemp Lotion emphasizes organic and natural ingredients (but does have Phenoxyethanol).<br /><br />Guayaquil Hemp Lotion feels gentle and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. It doesn’t list chemical fragrance and is labeled fragrance free, which is a big plus as some fragrances trigger sensitivities for me. But it still may have fragrance. I smell a faint non offensive scent and don’t know if it’s from added “essential oil” (last ingredient) or just the natural scent of the natural ingredients.<br /><br />Guayaquil Hemp Lotion has 250 mg of CBD (THC free), which is still being studied but “may” hydrate dry skin and help inflammation. The ingredients look good but this lotion does have moderately risky (per EWG) Phenoxyethanol in the top ten ingredients and drying alcohol in the bottom 5.

I’ve been using this coconut based hand soap daily and find it pleasant. It glides and lathers well when I rub my hands together and stays on my hands long enough to be thorough washing. This soap isn’t overly drying, though I almost always need lotion after hand washing. The lavender scent from essential oils is light, which is a plus as I’m not a fan of heavy scent. The container holds 12 oz. and the company sells 16 oz. refills (currently $6.95) in a paper based container styled like a milk carton to reduce plastic waste.<br /><br />The glass container has a modern design that looks nice countertop. It has a beige or taupe color silicone (or similar) material on the bottom and lower sides that prevents slipping and adds breakage protection. The plastic pump is also beige and good quality but may not last as long as the glass container. Beige isn’t my favorite color but it’s neutral and the company offers a blue shade that looks pretty in the photo. This soap has coconut oil, olive oil, potassium soap, aloe juice, vitamin E, citrus acid, sodium chloride and a natural essential oil blend (not in that order).

Way less obvious rough spot, my feet feel normal. It's just simple lotion with a great scent. It's fresh, uplifting, light. Not strong or lingering, but it's nice to put on a lotion that has an enjoyable scent. It isn't perfume, and I don't think it will compete with fragrance.<br /><br />5 stars.

The packaging is attractive, and the products came very well packaged and arrived safely in perfect condition.  This gel nail polish kit has  a little different texture than some of the kits available these days. This system has a complete nail prep and foundation product line-up much like the really great gel nails from 20 years ago. I'm hoping the long term quality of the nail growth and health with this product line,  is as good as the old products as well. As well all know, products can help your nails or destroy them, and this product line, the formulas remind me of the better products that were once available and were very expensive to buy.<br /><br />The thing people may not be used to is the last step of using the finishing wipe to remove the sticky layer once the manicure is complete. Some top coats are completely set and free of any tackiness right after the curing process. These products cure quickly with some heat, and 60 seconds seemed to be plenty of time. After the top coat and final removal of the tackiness, the nails are perfect. This kit doesn't come with color, so I experimented with a milky white and some blue ink, using the wood tools included in the kit to move and swirl the pigment around. It's a fun, creative way to change  up polish. I think stencils could be fun, and I do have mica powders, some bling pieces, to play with as well. I like these products, and the box came with a nice catalogue of other products available.<br /><br />This product is easy to use, I've experienced no irritation of my cuticles or nail bed, no itching or discomfort at all. The light is really cute, tiny and it works. Just one easy button and it turns off automatically in a minute. I pressed twice to get 2 minutes but found that 1 minute was enough, which is great.

It worked out just fine.  I like that the glitter is inside the base so that the outside is smooth to the touch. The different colors also makes it easy to differentiate between the various sizes at a glance. Next time I'll use the brush end to add some stripes.

The turbine is easy on her ears and comfy all over. It isn't bulky making it easier to get dressed with it on after a shower.<br />I use the wrap towel and it works great.

AELRWE7QQJRKDFHDQHVAODTF5FRA,Nice but thin,The hair is a very nice quality and it is the length expected but it is so thin and the tracks are so bulky. I'm so bummed they're so thin because my hair is so thick. They are all 3 individually wrapped bundles and tell you the length on them. The track part is super thick but the very ends just thin out sooo much. I guess that is how natural hair is so I will give it a try. I'm going to do a hand tied weft and will update after I wear them and let you guys know how they dry too. I have naturally curly hair so I always prefer hair that dried kinda wavy like my own and nobody ever says in the reviews that and I'm sure other people wanted to know too!,B085RS26YH,1628641370785,3.0

AHCR53CDYDQAS6C5TZXQWB4PWTCQ,Harder ends with glue,"These hairbands have a plastic interior. They are thinner in width and have enough gives that they work well for both children and adult heads. While the plastic is covered in a soft material that is ruched, the ends are a little bit harder. They have been folded but there is some glue and they aren’t completely without flaw.  I would say quality falls into the average lane.  Some of them have more glue visible than others but overall they’ve been done well enough. The key for the area that goes behind the ears is to position it so it’s not directly on the skin but more on hair. Another thing I like about these hairbands is that the set contains a large variety of colors.  Literally any outfit color or style should have a match in this set.",B08QHP717Z,1615859778230,4.0
AHCR53CDYDQAS6C5TZXQWB4PWTCQ,Renaissance head bands,"These headbands are extremely soft not only on the top but also on the bottom. They are wider in width so they have a very light feel on the head. They are larger and the puffiness on the top of them gives them a Renaissance feel. Inside the satin fabric that is braided, there are pearls throughout. The pearl accents give it an extra something special. They do feel very old world to me and they look adorable with outfits I put my daughter in. She has worn them with both dresses and pants.  I have had an occasional pearl accent fall off so they are more delicate than I would have hoped for.",B07YV9J2YZ,1615859021251,4.0
AHCR53CDYDQAS6C5TZXQWB4PWTCQ,Mega options indeed,"This is a huge set with a lot of color options. Everything needed from start to finish for little nails is included.<br /><br />There are two cubed nail files and buffers with the frozen nature, Anna, and Elsa printed on them. The nail polishes are very Arendelle<br />colors. Blue, purple, green, yellow, and orange are the main color themes in the set. They are natural and remind us of the elements; trees, water, ice, etc. There is a nail dryer that is in the shade of purple with an Elsa and Ana sticker on the front. It’s a petite size and perfect for little princess hands. I like that the battery case is enclosed with two tiny screws. They are safe and the children are unable to get to them. After the nails have been dried there are various gemstones and stickers that can be used. They are a small size and work for toddler and up. The gemstones are a little bit bigger and a little large on my toddler‘s fingers.  However the size is ideal for a child’s finger nails.<br /><br />My daughter has had so much fun with this kit. There are a ton of options for color. Naturally with so much to choose from, she never wants any one fingernail painted the same.<br /><br />The bottles have all been easy to open and use. They each have a different color as well as a different sticker for the handle of the nail polish. Again, everything is Frozen theme so it’s a huge draw for my little Frozen lover.<br /><br />Also this is a completely gift-able set. Every piece is nicely displayed and not one had come dislodged from the packaging prematurely.",B08CVTNQP1,1612923419554,5.0
AHCR53CDYDQAS6C5TZXQWB4PWTCQ,"Softest soft, not for exfoliating",I have been using a loofah but I feel like I wanted something that could easily reach my entire back without having to be a total contortionist in the shower. A brush with handle seemed like the obvious choice.<br /><br />The first one I bought had bristles on it and it was so hard it hurt to use so I couldn’t even bear the discomfort on my back. That one was better for scrubbing feet or less sensitive areas.<br /><br />This one is completely different and luxurious. The handle is a thick bamboo that is sealed. It’s a neutral colored wood but very attractive. There is some wrapped smooth rope on the base of the brush for holding. It makes the brush less slick when it’s wet and soapy. There is also a hole with a piece of that same rope for hanging. I use the rope to hang the body brush off of my shower caddy.<br /><br />The bristles are extremely soft! They are pure white and have been cut so that they have a texture for the skin.  The bristles are tightly positioned and there are a ton of tiny ones. They are as soft it not softer than some of my smoothest make up brushes. It’s soft enough that it could be used on my skin without irritating it.<br /><br />Now the flip side is that because it is so soft there isn’t any exfoliating action. I wouldn’t mind some slightly more rigid like a loofah for really deep cleaning. It’s even softer than a wash cloth but closer to a makeup cloth. This brush is really going to depend on the user and the need. It’s not for exfoliating.,B08N9RT9YD,1612054327215,4.0
AHCR53CDYDQAS6C5TZXQWB4PWTCQ,Powerful initial scent,"In the past, I have not had good experience with baking soda deodorant. Usually, my armpits breakout in a red rash. However, I have not had this deodorant irritate my skin.<br /><br />The lavender scent is earthy and natural. It has a deep lavender scent that is fairly strong. As it is a more natural deodorant, it does not glide like the big name brands. It has a slight moisture to it and by warming the deodorant, it slide slightly better.<br /><br />I have noticed that I need to reapply. Depending on my activity level, I have had to reapply two or three times throughout a day. I think the important thing to remember with these natural deodorants is to not expect them to perform like the big name brands. They provide minimal long term fragrance as well as sweat protection.",B086M8MZGB,1599699025404,4.0

AEQJM4TTCTH6MTHXAUQHIZ4JZZHA,"Great for a quick, easy eye when you're in a hurry that's gonna LAST!!","I loved the color I chose.  It's a light neutral with the tiniest bit of shimmer that I can run all over the lid of my eye, tap it/blend it out with my finger, and call it good.  And it looks like you've done one of those sleek, monochromatic eyes that just work.  It's very blendable and does play well with pretty much every other shadow I've paired it with.  It also has no issues with the eyeliners I've run over the top of it just to finish off the eye look.  I've worn it for 12+ hours and it looked pretty good at the end of a long day.  I'm a fan!!",B08JCX3DL7,1630565008961,5.0
AEQJM4TTCTH6MTHXAUQHIZ4JZZHA,"Love it when I microneedle and plasma, and now I use it daily!!","I've got 50 year old skin and I've treated it pretty horribly for the first 48 years, so I've got plenty of issues I'm dealing with.  Initially I wanted to use this when I microneedle (machine, not roller) and as part of my aftercare for plasma fibroblasting.  And I loved the results.  So much so that I started using it with my other serums in my nightly skincare routine.  I've noticed increased hydration (or more accurately an increase in the retention of hydration) in my skin.  There's also been an increase in the firmness of the skin, which I can't say is down to this product alone.  I'm sure it's because I'm using it in conjunction with the microneedling and plasma treatments, but it's definitely adding to the overall outcome that I'm loving.  The research available on EGF is plentiful and something that makes sense to me as far as an anti-aging ingredient.  So much of the info surrounding ingredients is mostly hype and very little science or actual research.  EGF is one that is backed by research and EasyDew provides a GREAT formulation!!",B08HRNPNR5,1621323021370,5.0

I had no idea that they would be such a hit.  I also had no idea how helpful they would be for things other than getting rid of a double chin.  I had one person who decided to quit smoking and one who tried to stop biting her nails.  They both used their Jaw Exerciser to help with their oral habit.  I'm not sure how effective it is with getting rid of a double chin, but it does seem to tighten up the jawline if you're using it every day.",B08L3W279N,1620744554370,5.0
AEQJM4TTCTH6MTHXAUQHIZ4JZZHA,"Quick, easy, blendable & at drugstore prices....gotta love it!!","I think we all have days where we're looking for something quick and easy when it comes to makeup.  Anything to get us out the door looking somewhat put together with the least amount of time involved is the goal.  If you're looking for a quick eyeshadow look that takes next to no time these are one answer.  Cream eyeshadow on one end and a brush on the other.  The brush is surprisingly usable, but since I've got older eyes (which means older skin that needs to be babied) I just use one of mine.  They go on pretty smooth and creamy.  Not a ton of pigment on the first pass, but it's very buildable.  The swatches on my arm are 2 passes of each color.  They also blend out really well.  I put a couple passes on my lower lid and blend it up into my crease and I'm good to go.  There is a bit of shimmer in this one, but it's not overwhelming.  Just a bit of sparkle that looks good even on aging eyes.  They make it through the whole day, but I did notice some creasing and breakdown after about 6-8 hours.  Not a lot, just enough to be noticeable.  Overall these were pretty impressive and I think they'd also be great for someone who was just getting into makeup too.",B08MPK4JRB,1618105113261,5.0
AEQJM4TTCTH6MTHXAUQHIZ4JZZHA,"This was kind of a ""gimmicky"" fail for me.","Generally, I love EasyDew products and they always seem to deliver what they promise.  That said, this product was a serious letdown and a bit gimmicky, in my opinion.  The delivery system of the product was completely unnecessary and did absolutely nothing to help with product placement.  The use of growth factor along with the claims to provide filling of lines and wrinkles instantly was where my disappointment came in.  Mostly because it did NOT do what it claimed.  The product is a clear gel that absorbs into the skin and does provide some hydration.  However, I think that's mostly down to the use of the hyaluronic acid it contains, which becomes a problem for me to use in my daytime skincare because I live in an absurdly DRY climate in the winter months and hyaluronic acid without access to moisture in the air or in the form of other products means it's going to suck the moisture from the surrounding tissues.....which means you end up with a VERY dry, wrinkly looking area anywhere you put this.  As for the EGF it contains, there are some studies that show it does help with repeated use OVER TIME, but it does not magically erase lines and wrinkles, and certainly not in the formulation offered here.  I feel like it's a case of a very good company, with very good skincare products that sadly made a mistake in caving into the ""quick fix"" trend so many other companies have.  This was a definite miss for me.",B07VDCD17L,1611806679933,2.0
AEQJM4TTCTH6MTHXAUQHIZ4JZZHA,Loaded with hydration & plant extracts that my skin NEEDS during the winter months!!,"These masks have become a favorite this fall and winter when my skin needs an extra dose of hydration.  I've just turned 50 and it's a constant battle to keep my skin hydrated just due to the aging process.  When you add in cold, dry air outside and hot, dry air inside it just makes it so much more difficult.  I've been adding masks to my skincare routine this winter and they've made a huge difference.  I try to do at LEAST one a week, but as it gets colder I've been using them every few days.  I'll use them at night after I've cleansed and used my prescription skincare and then I'll follow up with my nightly routine.  I love all of the plant extracts loaded into this one along with the niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  One thing to keep in mind though is that if you're using this (or anything with hyaluronic acid, really) and you're in a dry climate you need to make sure you provide additional moisture for the HA to bind to.  It's why I use this one at night since I keep a humidifier running on my bedside table that pumps that moisture into the air.  In addition to the hydration it also does a great job of noticeably minimizing the appearance of some of larger pores on my face which of course makes my skin look firmer and smoother.",B089D16BWJ,1611566405597,5.0
AEQJM4TTCTH6MTHXAUQHIZ4JZZHA,Gorgeous metallic shimmer that wears really WELL!!,"This is a 4 pack liquid metallic eyeshadow.  Icy silver, gold, a plummy/mauve, and a very deep midnight blue.  This shine factor on these packs quite a punch.....I don't think it comes across in the pictures very well, but they definitely are a metallic shadow.  They all are very opaque, but they can be sheered down a bit if you work with them right after you put them on the eye.  They do dry down fairly quickly so it's not something you can take your time to blend out.  I had the best luck applying them with my finger and blending them that way.  I didn't experience any creasing when I wore them and they don't transfer to other areas once they're dried down.  I've worn them for up to 8 hours and they didn't fade or start to slough off the eye.  They're pretty impressive for a liquid shadow.....for a liquid metallic shadow they're DAMNED IMPRESSIVE.",B08DK5D9J5,1611462546248,5.0
AEQJM4TTCTH6MTHXAUQHIZ4JZZHA,I've found the BEST BB CREAMS from Korean beauty brands & this is no exception!!,"So, I'm recently 50 (I'm wondering how long I'll keep adding recently to my age??) and during 2020 I fell in love with Korean skin care and Korean BB Creams.  This one gets high marks, and it's a bit different than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I ordered the lightest shade since I'm VERY fair and it worked perfectly.  That's one of the things I love about BB Creams in general, they provide coverage but they also seem to work with your skin tone rather than masking it.  This applied beautifully with a brush and my fingers (my preferred method).  I'm assuming it would work with a damp sponge, as well.  On me that tends to look cakey for some reason, so I don't generally go that route.  It worked well over multiple moisturizers and both of my favorite sunscreens.  I use a primer occasionally and had no problems with application when I did.  It goes on smoothly and blends out easily.  It's a very light formula and feels like I'm not even wearing makeup.  It doesn't have a high amount of coverage.  I would call it a buildable medium, as far as that goes.  Now, here's where it differs from the other Korean BB Creams I've tried.....it dries down to a very satin, skin like finish.  Most others end up with either a dewy or slightly luminous finish, which is fine.  This is the first one I've found that doesn't.  It's definitely not a matte finish, though.<br /><br />It wears really well.  I can get a full 10 hours of wear out of it, whether I set it or not.  That's another thing about the way this drys down, if you tend toward dry skin (I do) then you can get away with not powdering this one if that's your preference.  When I do use powder I go in pretty lightly, and usually just in the areas where my pores might be having a particularly ""showy"" day with a blurring powder.  The bonus that seems to come with most Korean beauty facial products is the SPF.  This is a PA+++/SPF 50+.  Now that doesn't mean I skip my normal sunscreen, cause you're never gonna convince me that what you get in foundation or BB Cream is adequate protection.....but I will never say no to MORE protection.  EVER.<br /><br />This is a beautiful BB Cream that works really well on aging skin, so I imagine it would be a dream on younger skin,  perfect or textured alike.  One other thing I noticed is that at the end of the day I still hardly noticed I was wearing makeup.  And when I washed it off my skin felt and looked pretty good.  It wasn't dried out and didn't have that worn out look that I've gotten used to seeing after a full day in makeup.  Definitely a keeper!!",B08DXCVRNY,1610190530982,5.0
AEQJM4TTCTH6MTHXAUQHIZ4JZZHA,"Excellent daily moisturizer, plays well with ALL my other products!!","Easydew has a winner in this one.  To start, it has a creamy texture and a light, fresh scent.  It’s super hydrating and has a great slip to it so it just glides over the skin.  It sinks into the skin beautifully, and fairly quickly, and leaves a dewy finish to your skin.  No weird residue or film left on the skin, and it works well with all of my sunscreens and foundations.  It provides you a nice, plump hydrated base to work with and that dewy finish holds up really well.  It works really well as a daily moisturizer for me during the colder/dryer months of fall and winter.  It will probably be a little too heavy to work during the day in the warmer months, but I can see myself using it as a nighttime moisturizer then with no problem.  Super versatile and definitely one I would recommend for daily use.",B088GWCVVJ,1605513049395,5.0
AEQJM4TTCTH6MTHXAUQHIZ4JZZHA,"Solid, heavy glass with an excellent mist & great for mask relief!!","I ordered these to hold the essential oils mix I use for sachets.  The mist from the sprayer is perfect to refresh the bags and to evenly distribute the scented oils over materials used in the mix.<br /><br />Since the COVID thing hit, and everyone in our house is dealing with prolonged mask use irritation and “maskne”, I’ve filled up a few more with a 100% green tea toner that can be sprayed on the face during the day.  It helps cut down on the inflammation from irritation and since it’s also an anti-bacterial it has helped control the acne, as well.  These are great to throw in your purse or keep in the car.  The glass is heavy & durable and the spray attachment screws down tight so they DON’T LEAK and the mist created is a nice, fine mist with zero “spitting” or errant streams.",B088YHN4JT,1603341485504,5.0

I use a makeup remover wipe first and then I use this also to catch what is left. What i noticed is that this isn't the type of remover where you just used it and then can walk away. You do have to use water to clean off your face after. I also have sensitive skin and I will say it did not irritate my skin at all. I didn't think it had any smell to it really.

It seemed like it was doing a good job then then the flakes came right  back so it was very surface  and didn’t penetrate. Then I’ve had very thick moisturizer  like the one you use at night. The problem with this is sometimes it made like little balls. I’m not sure how to describe it but it kind of made a layer and then peeled  off. So I needed something in between. This wa a perfect.

After I apply this to my face and leave it on for about 15 minutes, it still feels moist and slick when I go to rinse it off. The texture of this mask is more gel-like than it is clay. It feels lightweight and does not leave my skin feeling too dry and tight. This mask is effective enough for use during the winter, when my skin tends to be more dry.

I've included a picture of how I rigged mine to dry. I took one of those suction hook thingies, wedged it between two metal pieces of my shower caddy, and hang my loofah to dry. The important part of this is that in doing it this way, no part of the loofah itself touches anything. I read years ago that wherever something like this touches something else while drying, bacteria can collect there. I'm no scientist, but it makes sense to me, so that's how I've hung stuff like this for years. Works like a charm.

With a regular spray bottle, I always end up getting a lot of water on the floor when spraying my hair, then have a problem cleaning up the floor after cutting my hair as my hair is stuck to the wet floor.<br /><br />This bottle has solved my problem. The mist from this bottle is consistently super-fine. No rogue giant droplets. I can spray my hair down and not get water everywhere. The bottle is easy to hold, is a great weight and is balanced well. The trigger is easy to pull.<br /><br />This bottle is perfect to use for homemade wrinkle reducer for clothing as well. I just mix one cup of water and a tablespoon of fabric softener, shake well, then spray on fabric while pulling down on the fabric. The micro-fine mist dispenses a perfect light spray, so the fabric dries quickly.<br /><br />This bottle is very easy to clean so I can use it for several things, but I'd like to get more so I can stop switching the contents out.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.",B07TLMZL3T,1567865562084,5.0

I came across this SAISZE Jaw Exerciser which, like the YouTube ads, claim to be a Facial Fat Burner, and eliminating Double Chin Reducer for improved jawlines, so I finally bit it and ordered myself one to try.<br /><br />Unboxing was surprisingly taken aback, since I thought the packaging would be a little more elaborate, better packaging in bubble wraps, instructions, illustration, etc, the kind of packaging that I expect for items bought from my local Dollar Stores. Inside, it contains the blue Jaw Exerciser, anda laynard. Inside the Dollar Store-style plastic bag, there's nothing else. I was trying to figure out where does the laynard go, typically lanyards go inside a tiny holes, for example, on a smartphone. Since there's neither any ""tiny"" holes anywhere nor instructions, I went back to the product page, and looked at the product page photos, so the lanyard goes into the HUGE opening in the center of the Jaw Exerciser. This is nice, since this permits you to hang the Jaw Exerciser while it's not in use, instead of putting inside my pants pockets which is full of dirt & lint, probably not the best place. NOW, the only thing to try out is:<br />🤔🤔🤔🤔does this thing actually WORK?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔<br /><br />Well, you first should put the Jaw Exerciser in hot water for 5-10 minutes to soften it, and then after removing the protecting strips, you'd bite down to put pressure and allow the "" softened"" device to be molded according to your individual jawline, which will make the Jaw exercises more effective.<br /><br />I've been trying it for the last 2-3 months, while it's better than nothing - the Jaw muscles are probably the most neglected and difficult to exercise on a regular basis. So, for that purpose, ANY exercise is a plus, however, if you TOTALLY depend your double chins be gone on this gadget, you'd be drastically disappointed 😞☹️😞☹️☹️ Simply, it's a supplement to Health Diet, Regular Exercises, and Sleep Well, that's the ONLY way to burn fat, and eliminating double chins, this or ANY Jaw Exerciser is just a gimmick gadget.<br /><br />☹️😟🙄👎Not Recommended👎☺️☺️😟",B08L3W279N,1608140711217,3.0

But, my very first experience was a disappointing one, as the ""milky"" cleanser worked up nearly no foams at all. At this point, I don't even care that much about its list of active ingredients, no matter how good they are, I felt that my facial cleansing experiences were compromised by the lack of foaming in working up enough lathers, NONE to be visible. If this were a milky ""lotion"", and not intended to be washed off, then I understand!

Hence, I practice my daily skincare regimen religiously! My daily skincare regimen includes using serums, moisturizers, oils, eye creams. Sometimes I indulge in a spritz of Rosewater for refreshment.<br /><br />Now I use my face serums to do two things. First, of course, is for the benefit to my skin; and the various serums produce different effects simply because they consist of different main ingredients. Most all of them help protect against environmental contaminants, help reduce the appearance of lines, and some even help dark spots to lighten. Merlot Sunrise Serum uses natural grape seed antioxidants as its main active ingredient. (If you check the Merlot skincare line website, you'll see that their focus is on the use of grape seed antioxidants in all of their products.)<br /><br /> My second use is my own personal ""spa"" massage. I literally massage the serum into my skin. I focus on my temples, forehead, jaw line, nasal bridge, between eyes, and crows feet areas. I apply a firm, upward rotating massage with my splayed fingers. I thoroughly believe this helps me to relax, relieves tension, and massages the lymph system to aid in drainage. I just feel this is good for me. I even do this more than once a day when I have a headache or a particularly stressful day. This will work with most any serum.<br /><br />It works well with the Merlot Sunrise Serum because it in itself is refreshing, a light hint of ""fresh air"" scent, and literally feels good on my skin.<br /><br />The recommended use is twice daily - morning and evening - on cleansed skin. Then followed by moisturizer. I am totally enjoying this lovely serum.<br /><br />💞💓💕💯👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💯💕💓💞",B07WNBZQGT,1584329434277,5.0

I also love to turn off the lights, and light some aromatherapy candles & music. There's only one thing that's missing, a bath pillow so I can lay back & rest my neck as well.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this 『Charyeah Bath Pillow for Bathtub/Spa』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it's a decent sized bath pillow, not too large that it takes up too much room around your bathtub, but large enough to hold your head/neck comfortably.<br /><br /> INSTALLATION<br />🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁<br />Since I've never owned one, it would have been nice to have a picture of how it should sit in the tub; but eventually I figured it out since there's really only two ways to place it.

AF5IQSGLYMWLW4KH2V7VTUZLHUOA,Works Better for Much Older & Wrinkled Skins,"We all may want to age gracefully but aging does take a toll on our face in the most bothersome way. Sagging skin and age lines look utterly unappealing and make us self-conscious. While there are myriad of facelift choices, such as Botox, facelift surgery, non-surgical facelifts, etc., a large section of women still look for less painful and less expensive options to achieve the best results. An instant facelift is also in pretty high demand to restore a more youthful look and here comes the importance of a face tape. The affordable solution takes years off your face immediately without the use of harmful chemicals or painful injections.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across the 『Crystal Lemon Face Lift Tape』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it comes in a 40 band-aid lookalike patches of various sizes for different areas of our faces where you'd like to tighten the skins a little. I'm skeptical to begin with, but unless I try, I don't like to pre-judge anything, and let the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />The Premise<br />==========<br />These face lift tapes are basically a ‘band-aid solution to a mature face’. As the name reveals, it is nothing but a simple facial ‘tape’ that pulls back and stretches the skin to create an illusion of a tighter face. The tape is usually breathable, hypoallergenic, and of medical-grade. This non-surgical option gives a mini facelift instantly by smoothing out wrinkles and fine lines in a sagging and aged face. Since the last few decades, the facelift tape has been very popular only among Hollywood celebrities. But now, it has become a fast and easy at-home fix for anyone developing premature signs of aging.<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏<br /><br />When used correctly, this Face Lift Tape could make dramatic changes to your aged look by reducing fine lines and wrinkles instantly. They are effective in smoothing out very fine lines around the eyes and firming up the jaw, which is really difficult to achieve even with makeup. However, this typically works better in older seniors like my mom, they didn't quite work, or make any difference, as I'm not old enough. Remember it's easy to go from F to D, but not so easy going from A to A+, if your skins are not wrinkled bad enough, it's nearly impossible to see a difference 🙄😏🤔😁😄<br /><br />🙏🙏 If you find my review helpful, pls hit the 👍🙏🙏",B07VG2W8TT,1581825998021,2.0

If you stick them well you’ll forget you are wearing them (at least that is what happened with me) my only complaint with this cuties is the pen... is a nice eyeliner (felt tip) but is not so juicy, I had to reapply too many times and the lashes would keep popping off ! Next time I will use thing to stick them because the pen is mess free but takes long. 30 minutes after the pictures and video I attached one of them totally popped off. I was annoyed but the lashes themselves are gorgeous 🥰",B086GST51S,1596067497984,4.0

AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,you will see results if you commit to it,"I've been using this for 3 months now and I do think this works with longterm use. You obviously aren't going to see overnight results but if you keep at it you will notice a difference on your wrinkles. Luckily I don't have too many yet but I did use it on the little areas where I'm starting to see wrinkles. I noticed a tightening of the areas I used the laser on for the past 3 months. I really liked the hyaluronic acid serum that was included in the set - the serum felt gentle and has no smell (fragrance free). On some days where I didn't use the laser I would still use the serum to moisturize my face. I looked into purchasing just the serum, which they do have for sale, as I really like the product. The laser is easy to operate and charge (usb). I didn't use this daily as I wanted to give my skin a rest, but I think if you used this religiously then you would see results at a much faster rate. It isn't painful, but you feel a little zap. I would equate it to the same level of ""pain"" as a derma roller, that spikey/zappy feeling - not painful, not super uncomfortable. That of course, will depend on your skin sensitivity. I recommend using the lowest setting first then working your way up as your skin sensitivity will allow. Don't force your skin into what it cannot handle - listen to your body's reaction!<br /><br />I've seen so many of these laser type products for the skin/body, and never tried it because I didn't trust it. Nira is the first at home laser product that I decided to give a chance to, as I trust it. Overall I am not disappointed but do know that you need to commit to it if you want to see results. If you are going to use it once every few weeks then it will be a while before you see results, if ever. I plan to keep using this to stimulate my skin.",B08P2DZB4X,1635459121478,4.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,"amazed at the quality, design, and packaging of this brush set","[[VIDEOID:320116271bad63ca81ada02ccef2fa90]] This is the nicest packaged makeup brush set I've gotten on here so far. I don't mean beautiful packaging but the fact that they sterilized it and individually packaged the brushes in a sterile manner makes this product stand out from other brush sets. I prefer a clean, sanitized brush over a fancy box that I’ll end up throwing away. The price is also VERY reasonable for the quality of brushes I received. No, it is not high end brush quality but I'd rather get this starter set for $13 over one brush that would cost me $50-$80. I guess I'm not a makeup brush snob or a professional makeup artist so I just don't understand paying that much for a makeup brush. I thought these were great quality, the bristles are so soft, the color scheme is beautiful, and I love the plain matte handles. This one does not have any brand or printed words on the brush handles, which I haven't seen in a while. The brush sets I've gotten on here always has a brand stamp and sometimes they are a little corny sounding or tacky looking - this one is perfect. I thought the size of the brush is just right, good density - bottom line is I have no complaints about these! This is a set I would recommend getting. Don't let the price scare you off from thinking you are getting a bad quality brush set - it is better than I had expected.",B0919R1CYT,1624917504077,5.0

First of all, it is gorgeous with the pink ombre on silver. It has a good weight to it and is easy to grasp. The angle makes it so that when you are rolling it almost creates a pinching effect. It also feels cool on the face, with or without any lotion/serum. You can make it even cooler by storing it in the fridge prior to use. I also had some tightness in my neck area and it worked great as a massager too. Very good quality roller, this is one I highly recommend!",B08RYN11N9,1624403169440,5.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,loving ayurvedic skincare,"After trying AAVRANI's exfoliator, I fell in love. I was excited to try their other products so this was a great kit for that without having to purchase the full size of each product. This came in a beautiful cardboard box, fancier than most trial kits.<br /><br />There are four products to try:<br />- restoring serum<br />- activating exfoliator<br />- softening hydra-wrap<br />- eye rejuvenating elixir<br /><br />My favorite is the hydra wrap and exfoliator.<br />The hydra wrap is quite moisturizing and rich without feeling heavy, nor did it feel sticky/tacky after applying. I could slightly feel it on my skin after applying but it wasn't greasy or uncomfortable. The exfoliator has little shea nut powder beads in it to help exfoliate and scrub, and has a thick consistency. It is like your typical face exfoliator except it has great, good for your skin, quality ingredients.<br /><br />The eye elixir is good and felt like a gentler/less rich moisturizer compared to the face cream.<br /><br />I didn't like the serum because of the consistency - it is too liquid-y for me, and is almost like a toner than your typical serum. It felt fine on the face but I just didn't like how runny it was. The dropper style dispenser is great but it was like dispensing toner.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed AAVRANI's product line. I'm actually surprised at the quality of the packaging for a trial set like this. It is just as luxurious as the full sized products. I feel bad that I'll just be discarding the bottle/packaging after use. AAVRANI products products smell nice (some are even fragrance free as I didn't smell any fragrance) and nothing felt sticky/tacky or uncomfortable on my skin. I have been loving a lot of these ayurvedic based skincare brands as they seem to use better, cleaner, and gentler ingredients. If you are looking for something like that, do give AAVRANI a try - it is good stuff. I am saving this set to bring with me on weekend getaways.",B0949MJRHK,1623906196087,5.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,my (only) favorite BeautyStat product,"I've heard a lot of good things about this brand but I personally wasn't a fan of their other products. That said, this product is my favorite from BeautyStat. This is one I would be repurchasing once I am done with this bottle. I loved how it felt on my skin, and although it is a ""face oil"", did not leave my skin a greasy mess. My skin soaked it up soon after applying and just made it feel nice and moist. It just feels very light and will not feel like it is ""weighing"" down your skin like some heavy oils can do. It feels very gentle and I did not experience any itchiness or irritation. There is no scent to this, and is just 100% pure Squalane. If you are wanting to try this brand but not sure which product to get first, I would say get THIS.",B08RRSPNWV,1622704719036,5.0

I've seen this brand around but never tried it until now. I'm glad I did. It is a good body wash and great value, especially this two pack one. I plan to try the lavender/vanilla combo and shea/cocoa butter combo next. Good stuff!",B08SG2MBRY,1620717484573,5.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,I don’t do silicones (and petrolatum),"I heard a lot of good things about this brand but after trying it / seeing the ingredients list I wasn’t too happy. My favorite is the moisture essence with 100% plant based squalane. It doesn’t have anything else and that is the only product I don’t mind using on my skin. It doesn’t have any offensive scents and odors, and I like the way it makes my skin feel. That product is 5 stars for me. However, the other two, Skin Refiner and Moisture Boost, I am not sold on because of the ingredients. When I first used the skin refiner I loved how it felt - goes on smoothly, glides through my skin, and melts into it like butter. I looked at the ingredients only to see that it is, of course, filled with silicone (siloxane and petrolatum). I should have looked at it first before trying. I know studies may have shown that silicones are ok for skin, but for me personally I just don’t want that on my face. As for the petrolatum, that is something I just don’t want anywhere near my skin! While I loved the way it felt I didn’t feel good about the stuff in it. The skin refiner also made my skin itchy and tingly, even though I tried on three separate occasions, so I had to stop using it. The good thing about these products is they are fragrance free. Overall, I just did not like the two out of three items. I posted a list of the ingredients for anyone who needs to refer to it.",B08S1LWF9V,1618727303406,2.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,Facial sunscreen without the icky-ness,"I don’t like to put sunscreen on my face because it’s either sticky, has a white cast, smells weird, breaks me out or just does not go well with my makeup. For the longest time my facial “sunscreen” was just to avoid the sun, stay in the shade. That is still my mantra, but occasionally when I know I’ll be in the sun I put on a good Asian sunscreen - because they tend to uncheck all the boxes of the things I mentioned above. That said, this is another sunscreen I am adding to my collection. It did not feel uncomfortable on my skin and did not leave any white cast or blotches. It absorbed pretty quickly and my skin didn’t feel tacky. Also, this is SPF 50! All in all, this is another Asian facial sunscreen that I am adding to my “loves” list.",B08NJ5BTWG,1617975142734,5.0

AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,Patches break easily,"Having previously been disappointed with another one of their product (spilled and dried out), I was half expecting this product to arrive the same way. While this one did not arrive dried out, it was disappointing to see the eye patches were not drenched in the solution like most eye patches I’ve tried. They looked almost dry. It applies fine but just would have been better soaked in more solution.<br /><br />The patches also breaks too easily. I just put my fingernails on it and it split apart. I usually wear my glasses when I am using eye patches at night and have never experienced any that tore during use but these did. It tore near/underneath my eyeglass nose pad, which I had not touched with my fingers. When I went to remove them they broke apart in several pieces, which has never happened with any eye patches I have used.

AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,"Loving this product! It’s white, not blue, so don’t worry!","I am starting to ramp up my mask use again and do them about 3 times a week. This week I gave these a try and really liked them. First of all, the smell was quite nice - very light but a very nice smell. I actually try to put all the serum that was stuck on the package onto the mask because I wanted more of the nice smell on my face. The mask is soaked in serum and had a little extra left which I scooped out and piled onto the mask on my face. The material of the mask is soft. After 20 minutes it was not dry yet (still damp) but I removed the mask to a very moisturized face. I was able to massage the rest of the serum into my skin and sort of wiped off some of the excess. I really enjoyed using this mask and I’m actually looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />One thing I thought was that this mask is going to be blue colored, as it mentioned about a blue powder (copper peptide?). When I opened the package it was your standard white mask, white serum. It was a little confusing to me with the image of the blue cream in the front and the mention of a blue powder on the back of the packaging. Just know that this mask just looks like your typical face mask, soaked in white serum!",B083B67373,1611466095340,5.0

The wet wipes are not scented and I did not want to carry a bottle of perfume or scented spray with me because those are too heavy and bulky. I would be clean but I wanted to smell nice. These perfume wipes are the perfect solution for me. I now have these in my bag whenever I am out (to the park, grocery shopping, etc) and I don’t have to worry if I start to sweat or not smell as fresh as a bed of roses. What I’ll do is I wipe myself down with wet wipes first then I’ll swipe these on my neck and wrists. These are so convenient! I really like this scent as well. These would also be great for weekend getaways where you’ll have one less heavy thing (perfume bottle) to pack. The only issue is that it is not very cost effective - but you’ll have to weigh convenience with cost to see which is more important to you.",B0B2L218H2,1607935919725,5.0

After applying the serum to my face and spreading it all over, it just seeps into my skin and moisturizes. It did not feel sticky or tacky at all. I really enjoyed using this serum at night before bed and letting it work its magic. Now that we are in colder weather my skin needs a thicker face cream like oils/serum so this is just perfect.

They don’t really smell like alcohol or anything overwhelming at all, which I was surprised with. This would be a good wipe to bring with you to a restaurant where you can use it on your hands first then wipe down the table.

I didn’t mind the vanilla musk scent at all and thought it was pleasant. This is a good sized bottle and should last quite a while. For anyone who does not want to use this as a shower gel you can always use it as hand soap or as a refill for your hand soap. I already have plenty of shower gels I need to use up in my own shower so I am putting this in our guest bathroom, especially since the bottle has a nice floral design. My only complaint is this is a Korean product but they should have also included a list of ingredients in English in case it was a gift and the recipient needed to make sure they were not allergic to anything used in this shower gel.",B08YJV9YL2,1603594551669,4.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,a face cream for use in the colder seasons,"I like that this product uses oils like jojoba, cocoa, and coconut. This face cream is a little on the richer side (but not super rich and thick to where it is hard to soak into the skin). It is a little on the oily side but the thing is now that the colder/fall/winter season is coming, this is the perfect face cream for the season. I would not recommend this for use during the hot summer but your skin will drink this up in the cold. The scent was light and pleasant, but that always comes down to personal preference as some people are very sensitive to smell.<br /><br />It says this cream has collagen and stem cells, but I’m not sure how much of those ingredients are used in the formulation. It would be nice to know because if there is too little then there is probably very little anti wrinkle benefits. As with all beauty/skin care products it takes time to see the results. Overall this is a good face cream if you just want something moisturizing for the face but I can’t say yet if this will help erase or prevent any wrinkles.",B0851QJPZY,1602889307282,4.0
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,I love this face oil!,"I love face oils and never worry about them being too oily because I only use them at night before bed - that way they have time to seep into the skin and work while I sleep. I just love the smell of this one - especially when the smells are from oils / essential oils, and nothing synthetic. This bottle is just chock full of good stuff, good ingredients, and herbs and things. As we get into the winter season this will be perfect to keep my skin moisturized so at the moment I am using it sparingly. After trying this face oil I am excited to explore other products from Laloirelle because their formulation and ingredients used are exactly the type of stuff I love and trust to use on my skin.",B08DXZ5VXB,1601764335991,5.0

My night time face routine usually consists of step one, using makeup remover wipes to get rid of all the makeup, and step two, washing everything off with a facial cleanser. These do a good job doing the second round of cleaning my face. Please know that these are not to replace makeup removers and will not get your mascara off. Overall this is a great product for washing your face (no makeup). My only concern is these are a bit pricey per use, understandably so as they are individually packaged, so I would probably save these for travel convenience and not so much a product I would use daily at home.",B083BGJ4P9,1601606675167,4.0

I love that it comes in a good sized zippered pouch bag so I am able to put my other makeup / skincare products too. The products are all travel sized so this is a great set to bring with you on a weekend getaway. I recommend this set to anyone looking to sample their products before committing to full sized ones.  Also great for anyone who already love and use some of these items on a daily basis but need a mini version to bring with them on a short trip - nobody wants to lug around tubes of full sized skin care products when you only need a few drops on that short trip!",B085NYYLQ8,1596343075225,4.0

You will need a a few ziplock bags to contain the scent if you are traveling or else it will be all over your luggage. If you happen to mix it with food items, expect it to taste whatever you put on this bottles.<br />* don’t use for hand sanitizers or anything with alcohol base on it. I got it mainly for holding hand sanitizers for my whole family but the scent leaks so bad that I have to not use it for the purpose. It is also not good when squeezing coz it will not give you little amount.<br />* some liquid leaks too.<br /><br />This product will be good for lotion, toothpaste or shampoo/conditioner coz they have thicker consistency. But be aware that scents leaks.

AECTRGMRKOGAYIV3YXX73CQEQCSQ,Exactly what I wanted,This is exactly what I was looking for in a scalp scrubber. It has a fairly comfortable to hold handle which makes this easy to hang on to and not slip out of your hands even if you have super slippery shampoo. The bristles are firm enough but very flexible so they're quite comfortable on the scalp. I also love that you get so many colors here! I was able to gift several to my family and still have one for myself.,B08SQ31H8P,1613753146957,4.0
AECTRGMRKOGAYIV3YXX73CQEQCSQ,Is this a curling wand for dolls? So tiny!,"The product images for this curling wand are deeply misleading. It shows the curling iron on a model's hair and it looks like an average sized curling wand with three barrels. No, in person this thing is so tiny. It honestly looks like a curling iron for dolls. As you can see in my photo I'm using a pencil for scale. Each of these barrels is about a pencil and a half to two pencils big. Meaning that the type of curls you get are more like 1920s finger waves than anything you would probably want to wear today. It's just ridiculous.",B08NPBQR9L,1609108287714,1.0
AECTRGMRKOGAYIV3YXX73CQEQCSQ,Sturdy and great if you have a lot of hair,These are much larger in person than I was expecting but they're perfect if you have a lot of hair or long hair or you want to be able to clip a bun securely on your head. They feel like they are quite sturdy as well. I always break my clips and I think I'm going to have a hard time breaking these. I also appreciate the included hair ties!,B08HMLXW65,1608389515187,4.0
AECTRGMRKOGAYIV3YXX73CQEQCSQ,"Super comfortable, long wearing, and fades beautifully",This is so beautiful! I love the packaging and the color was really rich and a beautiful tone on my skin. Oftentimes reds can be too warm or too cool and this is just the right amount of warmth for me. It's very comfortable to wear and was nice and long wearing without being drying. and then I was really pleased with how beautifully it faded after a very long time. I'm excited to try different shades in this formula.,B08BY91SGT,1598808593461,5.0
AECTRGMRKOGAYIV3YXX73CQEQCSQ,Kind of firm but good shapes,"I'm not a complete beauty sponge snob and I've tried lots of different brands, both high-end and budget friendly, and I found sponges I liked at both price points. These sponges are definitely on the farmer side, so for that reason they aren't my favorite. They do expand when wet and I really do like the shape of the larger ones in this set--they are very similar to the Real Techniques sponges--but they're just not as soft and bouncy as some of the others that I prefer. If you're looking for a good drugstore-priced sponge I recommend the Loreal ones.",B07KXM94BT,1549914442598,3.0
AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,Pretty but Catches and pulls out a lot of hair,"This blingy headband is so pretty.  It makes me feel like I am living as a tudor or in elizabethan or renaissance times or something.  Would actually look great wearing to a Renaissance Faire.<br /><br />The problem is that the thing is not made in the best way.  First, when it arrived, it had already lost a stone – although it was floating around inside the plastic bag.  Try as I might, I can not get it to reattach as I think the prongs are now broken.  I will try instead to glue it back in.  Makes me wonder how long it will take for the other stones to also fall out…  Usually with jewelry, it is preferable to have prong set stones but apparently not in a headband as all those prongs grab and catch like every hair available on your head.  It pulled so much of my hair out when I tried simply removing it from my head.  (My pictures of the hair caught was AFTER I pulled most of the hair off the prongs.  It was easily 4 to 6 times as much stuck on it originally.)<br /><br />Because of the issue stated above I can only recommend for like one time use – knowing you are going to lose a bunch of hair because of it.  Otherwise I can not recommend. : (  Maybe if you have VERY short hair that has no way of catching…  (It also came with a freebie hair clip which I will give to a child and a sweet, cute paper origami heart - love that!)<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,Very simple yet flirty,"These headbands are pretty nice.  I only have one bad thing to say about them.  The ends of the bands (which are wrapped in coordinating colored cloth which is awesome!) is squared.  This makes the ends of the bands - the actual edge of the cloth) poke at my ears and head when removing them.  Putting on was not a problem as I seem to be more careful.  Not sure if you are truly running around and active where they may continue to poke you through the day - have not worn mine long enough yet - and today is a calm day anyway.  Not sure why they made the pretty end so squared...<br /><br />Otherwise these headbands are very nice. Nicer than I though they would be.  I actually thought they may look far too childish but in actuality they are very nice looking - simple yet flirty.  They do not look infantile in any way.  They also fit pretty well and are comfortable to wear - except for the pokey bottoms.  I also thought that the colors would be an issue as I am not much of a pastel person but because they are thin it really is not an issue.  I think they will go along with a lot of clothes - even if it picks up just a hint of a color that you may have on.  Plus - even though the ends are uncomfortable - I LOVE that they are finished with the same exact color - most bands take the cheap way out and finish all the colors in black or something.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""helpful"" button.

AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,GOOD button placement - also stays put on your head due to fabric,"I like these mask headbands.  First - the button placement is PERFECT!  Some headbands have the buttons way too high to use - these are set PERFECTLY.  I LOVE that  The colors are pretty nice too - especially for office wear! Not sure how often I will use the print ones - but the other colors are perfect for the office.  And when I am going out with my mask on - I never leave home without a mask headband.  It makes life so much easier and the mask more secure and much more comfortable.<br />The material is GREAT for making sure it does not slip off your head.  The velour makes sure it stays put and grips your hair and doesn't move.  The buttons are very pretty, stylish, and very much color coordinated with some of the headbands.  The only thing - because the buttons are 'so nice' and sort of concave - once you stick your mask on the button sort of sticks out a bit - more so than a flat button.  BUT with that being said - it grips your mask securely.  Some flat buttons let the mask slip off sort of easily.  AND it is just a button so who cares if it does not lie perfectly flat against your head. I mean I am already wearing a mask - so how picky can I really be.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : )",B08PTZL95G,1611774994202,5.0
AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,Sketchy...  Ingredients?  Organic my eye!  For tea? - I don't think so,"First off for anything touting that they are Organic and then come in a non-descript bag - no ingredients, no country of origin or manufacture - no brand info, etc. that is SUPER sketchy.  Seriously doubt these are Organic - no marking as such - but there is no info whatsoever anyway - so who knows what is truly in them.<br /><br />I put a ball in my glass mug and poured boiling water anyway.  There is no ""flowering"" like you may get from flowering tea balls.  It just sort of filled the entire mug with flowers - petals and flowers.  Like the entire mug.  It was the consistency of a thick stew.  You might get a few sips for the space that is left after the flowers expand.  I was actually impressed with how much ""flower"" was there from that tiny and light ball.<br /><br />I sipped it and was snot impressed with the flavor.  Light at that and must have been chamomile as chamomile smells like chicken soup to me and I am not a fan of chamomile or this ""tea"".  It was the consistency of soup, though... a hearty chowder.  It was not fragrant in any way either so I think although you get plenty of flowers for a tub - you are defeating the purpose of adding fragrant flower petals to your bath.  Plus no ingredients anyway.  It seemed like all flowers - it really did - but I am not really sure what is in there.  Plus some people are allergic to certain herbs and flowers anyway.

AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,Wipes are nice and good for the environment,"While these wipes are very nice plus good for the environment - they are probably not something you will use all the time - only because of their price.  I think these are good for one off things - like toting with you when you go camping or hiking or traveling or something.  Maybe to keep in the car - just in case (although heat will surely make them dry out).<br /><br />They are unscented - which I love.  I hate things that are loaded with perfume.  They work well to cleanse a particular area.  You can't use them for like a full body thing while camping in deep woods as you would have to use a few to get the job done.<br /><br />Overall very nice for the occasional usage - ALWAYS good to have!  They also left my skin feeling nice. Not drying - not oily either.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful - why not click the ""Helpful"" button?  Thanks! : )",B08DK74M1P,1605305846635,5.0
AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,Wow! Soooooo pretty!,"Pictures do not do these headbands justice.  There was another reviewer who said how nice they looked - like Swarovski crystals - more high end.  Her description was great and her photos were good - but the photos are nothing like the actual headbands.  They look soooooo much better in person.  They really do look like lovely high end bands.  I was surprised how nice they look on - in real life.  In the box - you are like - they are OK.  But once on - WOW!<br /><br />Now they do not grip the head or hair really - sort of loose on top of my head but they are secure on the sides.  I didn't feel like they were coming out or anything.  They are relatively comfortable to wear as well.  BUT they will not really hold your hair well - either.  These are really just for looks mostly - which is fine with me as they REALLY are pretty.  Are they perfect - no - on two of them the beads are spaced a bit here and there - in your hair you won't even notice, though.  Plus they come in a variety of colors.  I can wear up to three and make it look cute.<br /><br />I guess you could wear these with jeans and a tee for some pizazz and more of a girlie look - but they really are pretty enough for special occasion events and parties, and stuff.  Especially in low light situations - the crystals catch the light and look really lovely!<br /><br />If you find this review helpful - why not click the ""Helpful"" button?

AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,"Feels and washes lovely - smells like MEN'S COLOGNE, though :(","This wash is luxurious.  Just a couple of pumps was all I needed for my shower.  The directions say to use your hand and rub in but I used a pouf and it worked well.  The foam really is luxurious and goes a long way.<br /><br />My problem is the very strong scent.  In no way does it smell like mint or rosemary (two scents that I LOVE!).  To me, it smells like a men's cologne.  In fact it smells just like this hand wash that a male friend keeps in his bathroom.  I think guys would probably like this very much - me, not really.  The scent is also VERY strong while using - like VERY.  The good news is that it leaves just the lightest scent on your cleansed skin - thank goodness.  Just very light.<br /><br />It left my skin clean and soft.  Too bad I really do not like the scent as I will likely not be using it again. : (  Sad too as I truly appreciate how it is clearly marked Vegan as that is important to me.

AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,Well made bottles - work well,"This glass bottle set is well made and sturdy.  The mister/sprayers work well too.  I think they are far to pretty to use with general cleaning so instead with these pretty bottles I added some filtered water and essential oils.  This way I have a natural air spray and I can also use the spray on soft surfaces too.  Now my home smells fresh and lovely whenever I want to spritz.  The nozzle seems to work well too as some sprayers out there just make a wet mess everywhere - these do not.  They work and spray well.  Plus they are pretty enough to leave out and not hide away - I love that!<br /><br />I like that they come with a funnel, separate caps, and stickers for the bottle.  So great!

AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,NOT spirals in any way shape or form - but did a decent job making some body in my hair,"First off - how these arrive in the bag - like a little roll - is the way they will end up in your hair.  There is no way to make them spiral at all.  More like standard old school curls.<br /><br />I found them a bit hard to use as well - as I found it a big pain to get the stick through the curler.  I ended up squashing like four of five on the stick at a time (since that was the truly painful part) and then using it on my hair one after the other.  Plus even though I cut my hair to like shoulder length - these are actually pretty short - just for the ends of your hair really.<br /><br />With that being said - I tried these one night after a shower - letting my hair dry by at least half.  I put the curlers in while watching TV.  Left them in for like an hour, ran my hairdryer over them until my hair felt dry and took them out.  My hair definitely had some bounce and was sort of curly.  So if you are looking for body - these might definitely work.  If you are looking for tight curls (especially spirals) - probably look elsewhere.  On the plus side - for work the next day - my hair still had some body and felt thicker when I put it up.  So again - they did definitely add body to my hair.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : )",B08BLKFGND,1599438103571,2.0

AGADKXWLAJJ4FGWIDIWAPJL5A6HA,A Lovely Change From Hospital Soap,"We do not get out a lot, but I do go to a lot of doctors' appointments and hospitals and there is nothing I hate more than hospital soap. It is abrasive and it has a scent that is so distinct and it sticks with you for hours and hours after you have washed your hands. I loathe hospital soap.<br /><br />These little soap sheets are simply amazing. Not only do they pack light - I can stick one little tin in my bag and it takes up almost no space at all, but the sheets themselves are tiny. The sheets dissolve nearly instantly in water, lather perfectly and the smell so nice. They are like a little bathroom oasis at the doctor or hospital. The scent does not linger though, so please do not be worried about smelling like ylang ylang for hours on end.<br /><br />My hands always feel clean when I leave the bathroom and I have even used a sheet to wet a paper towel and wipe my face off.",B09473GGM4,1626097230963,5.0
AGADKXWLAJJ4FGWIDIWAPJL5A6HA,A Real Lavender Lotion That Works,"I am sort of a lavender lotion expert. I love the stuff. Most lotions that have lavender either smell like nothing or smell like an entire shop of flowers. Those lotions that do get the scent right usually are full of chemicals.<br /><br />I had never heard of Kneipp before but I really like it. This lotion is not thin, but if you are used to a thick cream it will seem thinner. It does take a little work to absorb, but it is worth it. The scent is not overpowering and I think it does not linger, but is just right.<br /><br />One complaint I do have is that the bottle had no safety seal. For $18 I would think the tube would come with a seal on the top. I was not sure if the bottle had already been used and returned. I just decided to go ahead and be brave and I'm still alive. Kneipp needs to add a seal on their tubes.<br /><br />This is not a sticky or overwhelming lotion and does not leave your skin feeling greasy. Sometimes paying a little more for a product that really works is worth it and this is one of those times.",B01MSF13T1,1614606002668,5.0

I have been using masks to combat skin issues I have been having from wearing medical masks. So far this mask has been one of my favorites.<br /><br />- Extremely hydrating and cooling.<br />-Made my skin very soft and smooth for a couple days afterwards.<br />-Easy to use.<br />-Large enough to cover my entire face.<br />-Enough balm to cover my face, neck and probably my entire body.<br />-Mask did become invisible when I had it on. Not that this is super important, but my husband does a mask that makes him look like a robber and it was just an interesting observation.<br /><br />-Has an insane amount of the cucumber balm - so much extra that I needed to wipe it off before I could actually rub it in after I took the mask off.<br />-The balm took forever to dry after I took the mask off. It was not bad, but my face did feel sticky for hours afterwards and I woke up with a tacky face in the middle of the night. Seriously, it was a lot of cucumber.

AGADKXWLAJJ4FGWIDIWAPJL5A6HA,Decent Brush For Thin Short Hair,"As most of us are in quarantine and not currently getting regular hair maintenance, having weird hair right now is just normal. I am growing out a pixie cut, not by choice, but by mandate of the State of Michigan. I have experienced a number of difficult hair transitions during this stay home, stay safe period, all of which I hope to never experience again. Currently, my hair is just too short to tuck behind my ear, so it is constantly falling in my face, but thankfully, I am past the super trendy mullet stage.<br /><br />When I had my pixie cut for seven years I washed my hair and dried it with a towel and went on with my life. No comb, no brush, no anything. It was really nice. Now that I actually have hair that tangles and needs attention I require tools. I have a brush with tight bristles that I like, but it pulls. I use leave in conditioner gel that seems to help, but I still pull a lot of hair. I have a very inexpensive comb that does absolutely nothing and I should probably just recycle it.<br /><br />This specific comb and brush set is definitely not the fanciest around. The comb has some heft to it and it does a good job getting my part straight. The brush is very stiff compared to my other brush, but it does not pull all my hair out when it hits a tangle. I also like that this brush doesn't mash my hair down. I have thinner hair and this brush doesn't make me look like I have thin hair.<br /><br />I don't use any styling products or tools, so I am not hard on my brush. I think this brush will hold up just fine in my hands, but I think if I person were using it with lots of accessories and products it might be a placeholder for a more expensive brush.",B08BY9P4HR,1597153924310,4.0

AHPG65LKS3QKRWDUWAKZNLEK5RZQ,Excellent magnetic lashes!,"I love these. I like that they are mink. And I especially like how they have the little case with a mirror. That’s impossible to find. They work great and stay on my whole 12 hour shift. They are waterproof and you can’t scrub off with just water, not that a person would try. Cold cream works ok. But if you get some lash cleaner or makeup remover and apply to the end of a cotton swab and gently rub along lash, they practically fall off in seconds. At first, I was peeling them off because I thought since it’s magnetic that’s all that’s sticking. But then it’s hard to get the eyeliner off. After using a remover it’s much better. Don’t worry if you have trouble using liquid eyeliner. I promise after practicing a time or two, it will work perfect. If you get out of line, very quickly wipe off excess. It dries quickly. If it takes longer to put them on after applying liner, it will probably still work good. If you put lashes on sooner than you are supposed to and it’s not dried as well as it should be, it still works. It’s just a little messier for the lashes after removing them. I’ve learned to also use my lash remover or makeup remover to clean my lashes afterwards. They will have some liner dried to them and this builds up. I put them in my palm and squirt some on and gently rub with my finger or a swab. I don’t take much effort but get some of it off pretty good. They last me a good 5 or more times depending on how bad I bend them putting on lol. That’s another thing, you don’t have to have a real steady hand to apply them. I use my fingers instead of the holder thing. I normally start in the center but sometimes on the inside. You can adjust them if they are too long on one side. You can also trim them. Please don’t do this while they are on lol. I tried this and cut too much off. I was lazy lol. Most the time I have mine bent good to put on. Well, I should say curved instead of bent lol. They aren’t as fragile as they would seem. I love them. Only thing that worries me, if you ever are in an accident with them on and they take you for an MRI , I worry my eyelids will pull off because of the magnetic particles lol. It’s not funny but something to think about. Surely they would wash them off first. Don’t think about it. Try them. After all, beauty comes at a price lol.",B08NTD1NM1,1620372579752,5.0

Then I sort of blended it in just a little with my finger. It dries on and stays the whole work night 12 hours. It’s great. It feels a little like when something liquid would dry on skin but not bad and doesn’t show wrinkles. It may be for younger people but this 50 year old loves it.

AHPG65LKS3QKRWDUWAKZNLEK5RZQ,Beyond my expectations,"So even though I used to do hair and should know about magnetic eyelashes, I didn’t and I was SO skeptical. I finally decided to try them. These things exceeded my expectations by far! The first time I chose the not so dramatic ones but they were thicker than my own. They did great. They were only a tad heavy. They stayed on 8 hours but I took the eyeliner with me to work and touched them up. I honestly think they would’ve stayed on longer if I hadn’t have forgotten and put regular eyeliner on first out of habit. I do wish this came in another color besides black as I have blonde hair and it’s dramatic. But once I wore them a while I realized it looked good. After work, I removed them easily. My eyes were itchy a little but when I woke up that evening they were back to normal. Another reason I think they didn’t stay on 12 hours was instead of following directions, I read somewhere that a person put the eyeliner on the the lashes while still wet and it worked better. The next night I followed directions. Put a coat on let dry then add another coat. Honestly, it pretty much dries by the time you finish both eyes. Don’t forget to shake it up though. They were very easy and quick to do. The only real time it takes is deciding which ones to use as there are so many nice selections. I realized the ones I thought were too dramatic when choosing actually look the best. I’ve gotten o many complements. And this time they stayed on all night. I think I could sleep in them and they would stay on. I wouldn’t though. The corners might poke your skin on inner eye when you close them but this can be remedied by snipping a tad off with scissors once you try them on and see how they do. I didn’t have to trim mine. Also, I had put a pair on and decided I liked the longer ones better so I took off the first ones and applied the others. I never redid the eyeliner. They still worked and stayed on. There’s magnet particles on eyeliner and the lashes are on a magnet strip. They are easy to remove but stay on like they are real. That sounds crazy. I didn’t want to ruin my own lashes with the glue kind plus I can’t get them on good enough without adjusting them. These you can take off and adjust. This gave me confidence I lacked in doing this. Plus, my hands aren’t that steady. When removing, start at corner and peel off. They won’t hurt your lashes. To remove eyeliner I used cold cream. It worked well. Just water doesn’t work. It is waterproof very much so. So cry all you want with these lashes ladies. You won’t have to worry about them falling off. One last thing, my skin is sensitive but they haven’t really bothered me so that is a big plus.",B08DNCR582,1604908215837,5.0

AGRKJRPX6I5DQPODOC4YJ7CT4XWA,Quick and powerful,"It took a while to get this review together because there was a lot to unpack with this steamer and all the little extras that came with it; however, what stood out most was how fast and powerful the steamer itself was.<br />If you were thinking you'd be waiting around a few minutes for this thing to start producing steam, chances are you will be pleasantly surprised by how little time it takes for the device to start pushing out huge clouds of steam.<br /><br />While the instructions that come with this set are detailed, using the device itself is fairly straightforward.<br />Simply be aware that the steamer needs to be plugged in to work; moreover,  you will probably want to sit during its operation so that you can lean over it for a few minutes at a time.<br />That means you'll want to find a place where you can use the steamer comfortably, like a vanity or desk.<br /><br />Other things to keep in mind as you consider buying this.<br />- The handheld, portable, rechargeable device is a mister, not a steamer. This wasn't completely clear on the product page, so I want to make note of it. Basically, the mister is a nice thing you can use to cool down and refresh your skin on the go.<br />- Packaging suggests two different types of water for the steamer and mister respectively.<br />  - steamer = distilled water<br />  - mister = mineral water<br />- The steamer's cord is about 2.5 feet long, which is something you will want to consider when decided where you will be most likely to use the steamer.<br />- The little extras like the headband with ears and the pore clearing tools make this a great gift to give someone who enjoys getting and giving facials.<br />- The manufacturer warns that acne which is hormonal in nature will not respond to the steamer<br />- The instructions also advise you not to use the steamer everyday, nor more than 10 minutes at a time. Accordingly, this is not something that is likely to add a lot of time to your daily routine, but rather something you will use once or twice a week.<br />- The steamer itself is cute and compact, so you're not giving up a huge amount of space if you get one, nor do you necessarily have to hide it in between uses, unless you want to.<br />- The steam produced is hot/warm and there is no way to control the temperature; however, you can easily regulate how you experience the heat simply by adjusting the proximity of your face to the steamer.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this facial steamer set as a purchase for yourself or as a gift for someone else who enjoys giving/getting spa treatments at home.<br />I personally like the effect it had on my skin; I felt as though using it has helped with both the cleansing and hydration of my skin.<br />Once you get through all the instructions, procure the right type of water for your steamer, and identify where you want to set it up, you will be rewarded with an easy to use machine that produces copious amounts of steam very rapidly",B08P4YQ3K5,1615391343544,5.0

But going through postpartum, I ended up with some hair loss that is now in the process of growing back. I used to love getting Keratin treatments in the salon because it always made my hair feel so good, look super shiny and healthy, and just overall made me feel good. I was anxious to try this at home Keratin system to see if I could get similar results, and much to my surprise, I did! Not only is it easy to do, but my hair looks, and feels so much healthier! It really did wonders on smoothing out some of the frizzy dead ends that need trimmed, and created a sort of gloss look overtop my hair. It brightened up my naturally dark ashy hair color, and was just what I was looking for.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for anyone with long hair looking to revitalize your long locks!",B07SLFWZKN,1615921592486,5.0
AFPPNF3RSFMMNC5UAM6V4B475MBQ,Nice Falsies!,"So overall as far as false eyelashes go, these are pretty good.<br /><br />Magnetic lashes have become sort of a craze here in the last year or so, and I can see understandably why. The key however to applying them is to make sure you have a quality magnetic liner for application, and patience.<br /><br />I'm not huge on wearing false eyelashes or makeup on a regular basis, however for things such as family photos and an occasional date night out, it can be fun to get dressed up and feel a little ""extra"".<br /><br />The lashes themselves are really good quality, the liquid eyeliner goes on pretty well, but my only beef is that it can be sometimes difficult to get the magnet part to stick. But once it does, they look fairly natural.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend people to give these a try. They are priced well for having 6 pairs, can be reused, and the set contains everything you need to try them out. Overall, recommended.",B08NTD1NM1,1613679278001,4.0

Currently I have one for a mixture of house cleaning products with some essential oils mixed in, as well as water in one to take care of several house plants. These would be useful for a wide variety of things including beauty care, cleaning, and watering plants. Because they are glass, they have a comfortable weight to them, much better than cheap plastic. The sprayers all worked easily and didn't leak, and it was easy to control the type of spray output. Very happy with their quality.",B08HGZXLP6,1611261140400,5.0
AFPPNF3RSFMMNC5UAM6V4B475MBQ,Great nail set for little girls!,"I have a 6 year old niece who is obsessed with all things Frozen, and who is a complete and total ""girly girl"". She loves doing her nails and makeup, so when I saw this kit I knew it would be the perfect item for her to try out while over at our house. She was so excited when she saw it, and immediately wanted to try it out. Upon opening up the box, there were a ton of nail polish colors to choose from, several nail embellishment options, and even a ""salon"" dryer for her to use. Best of all, it was easy for her to pick off and did not damage her nails! Highly recommended as this is a great kit for kids!",B08CVTNQP1,1611091093072,5.0
AFPPNF3RSFMMNC5UAM6V4B475MBQ,Great DIY kit,"As someone who has been doing at home manicures for several years and trying out several different types of products ranging from acrylics, gel polish, powder dips, and now polygel. Poly Gel nails remind me a lot of acrylics, but are a little bit easier to apply, and you can get good length without having to use artificial tips. I was worried not using tips would make them more prone to breaking but so far I have not had that issue.<br /><br />Using the liquids and the nail shapers, its actually quite easy to put on. I've had relatively good luck getting them to last about the same length of time as acrylics, roughly 2 weeks. This set has some nice color options and seems to be high quality. Overall I'd recommend to anyone wanting fancy nails but to save some money, to definitely try at home manicures at home, using this set is a great place to start. Its important to know though that you need a UV light which is not included with this kit. Regardless, I still recommend it!",B088TXBCB5,1610384606444,5.0

I love this formula, very easy work with it doesn’t dry fast so you have to build or layer. What I like the most that after putting under the lamp your nails don’t have that tacky layer.  So the poly gel is sheer but building as in adding more will make it thicker.  I also like the nail forms.",B08DHZW3LK,1604425532398,5.0

I am excited about having the topcoat, but for darker colors where the matte would be better contrasted. The gel is not the longest lasting that I've had and I've noticed the matte top coat specifically burns a little on my nails when under UV light.

The liner is hard to control and leaks a bit. I have had it seep into the corners of my eyes multiple times and it stings a little bit.

AGFAOH3NMW2D7YV3QVZSTXMTSKIQ,Did Not Work At All,"What you get - 2 10ml rollers with Vitamin C serum eye treament for men<br /><br />Pros - this is obviously designed with men in mind and it doesn't have any scent so my husband was happy to try it out.<br /><br />Cons - it did nothing even when used for a month. There was no cumulative improvement at all. It seems to be very watered down and you are paying for a lot of filler content and very little active ingredient which is probably why it didn't work.<br /><br />Overall it seems that you are definitely paying for the packaging and the ""male"" appeal. It's like the opposite of the pink tax.",B0B8SFDJN9,1652794728853,1.0
AGFAOH3NMW2D7YV3QVZSTXMTSKIQ,Good not Great,"This definitely moisturizes, there is no question about that. I found that because of the texture (it's almost whipped) that you end up needing to use more product than with many of the options. Not sure that my skin would be stressed - but it definitely goes through a lot with the amount of make-up I put on it.  It is supposed to be fragrance-free and there's definitely not a perfume element - but maybe there should be, It smelled weird to me. I can't put my finger on what it was exactly just that I didn't really like it, but I can be picky over scents so that might just be me. Overall it was good - but not great - but also it's a mid-range rather than a higher price product which should be taken into account.",B07W1WJZFG,1619896615540,3.0

The primer gives a really great base and helps the foundation to look smooth and not crack, the ONLY downside is that for me, it doesn't allow my skin to breathe enough and I end up with breakouts if use it more than on the odd occasion which is a shame.

This set comes with two liquid liners which I love! The lashes stay all day with no issues at all and the variety of styles means you can have them looking more natural - or super dramatic.  The only thing I would say is that they say reusable - and I know people that do wash and reuse them but my eyes are sensitive and so I only use each pair for a single use.,B08KJF6Y6C,1612546754111,5.0

AGFAOH3NMW2D7YV3QVZSTXMTSKIQ,Layer Up For Best Effect,I used the copper and the white/silver to create the effect in the picture. I love that the color was long lastig and definitely shimmery.  It didn't flake off as some glitter based ones do.  I found the best effect occurred if I let a layer dry and then added more - to build up the shine but if I didn't wait long enough between layers it did get a little clumpy.

AECIT3NMW6RKABFS6YOCYX4YUYOQ,"Faint scent doesn't linger, good lather.","I like the ingredients, not super in love with the scent, but it's faint and doesn't linger, so no problem really. This worked up a good lather, not the best, but better than others with a washcloth; the lather didn't disappear either so I didn't need to keep going back to the soap. It's a nice size, larger than others I've tried, and seems like it will last at least a week, probably longer. Non-daily use it could last much longer. As far as moisturizing, I can at least say it didn't dry me out, which is a plus.",B08N6YHQXT,1618777864965,4.0

AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,My skin went from dry/dehydrated to oily after using this toner 😔,"The sedum extract in this essence was quite intriguing to me.  As someone with chronically dry, sometimes dehydrated skin I thought this toner could help me.  ""Sedum is a succulent leaf known for its intense hydration, vitamins & mineral level.  It holds more hydration than watermelon and is rich in phytoestrogen that further boosts hydration and improves the skin condition.""  When I read that, I thought this sounded like the recipe for perfect skin, but every time I use this essence my face turns super oily.  I have never experienced this kind of change from any of the hydrating essences I own.<br /><br />The scent on this is light, clean, and fresh, very herbal.  You should be aware that this product is fragranced with natural fruit oils & extracts.  A few minutes after application though, the scent dissipates quickly.  My skin is crazy reactive & very sensitive, but I did not experience any adverse reactions to the ingredients used in this essence.<br /><br />There was also a generous amount of samples from Celimax included with this toner.  😀  They sent 2 Noni ampoules, 3 serum packettes, and 2 AHA/BHA exfoliating/brightening pads (labeled for underarms, but can be used elsewhere).  Korean brands are so very gracious with samples!  Thank you, Celimax! ❤<br /><br />Both the package & bottle both come safety sealed.  The bottle is of nice size (150ml) and features a shaker style spout for easy dispensing.  I pour a small amount of the essence into my hands, then pat into the skin after cleansing. Then I apply my serums & moisturizer.<br /><br />Though I don't find this product to be a particularly good fit for my skin right now (during the hot & humid Florida summer heat, when my oil production is already at it's peak), I think this essence may work better for me in the winter.  I do think it's a nice product, so it still gets a 4 star rating from me.",B084WP4XS8,1623199074646,4.0
AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,Smells like Hawaiian Punch 😋 Great formula and I love the no-spill pump bottle!,"This non-acetone polish remover from Plant Therapy smells so good! To me, it smells a lot like fruit punch (Hawaiian Punch, to be exact). You can smell it from the outside of the bottle as soon as it arrives. But don't smell it straight from the bottle, or on your cotton round... the solvents themselves have a very strong odor! After you use the product though, the only thing lingering is the fruit punch scent on your fingertips. There is a little bit of an oily residue left behind, but it beats the ashy dryness of straight acetone.<br /><br />The leak-proof pump bottle works amazing! If you knock the bottle over, it does not spill. I love that! The cap on the bottle flips up to reveal the pump dispenser, which you press down to pull your liquid to the top. I did not have any issues during shipment, so I think this bottle will be fabulous for travel. This acetone-free formula removes traditional crème & shimmer polishes with little effort. The solvent base contains Ethyl Acetate & Isopropyl Mistrate. I wouldn't use this as my first defense against removing glitter lacquers, and I wouldn't use it to soak off gel polish at all. (Pure acetone is best for both of those options).<br /><br />Plant Therapy products are proudly made in the USA! 🇺🇸",B08NC4378M,1617149633253,5.0
AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,The LED aspect explained & my experience with these masks 🎭 (spoiler alert: I LOVE them!),"THIS IS A LENGTHY REVIEW, BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH THE READ:<br /><br />Avajar is a k-beauty skincare manufacturer out of Seoul, Korea, closely affiliated with the K-pop group, Super Junior, who is the face of the brand. Avajar, as a company, has been making face products since 2019, with a focus on offering quality ingredients at a fair price. In this particular product they have created (a series of) sheet masks that contain the same cream as their LED Ring Light Cream Moisturizer. The original LED Ring Light Cream Moisturizer is pictured here on the sheet mask packaging. That moisturizer actually comes with a mini LED light on top of the jar, which was designed to be used as the product applicator. The LED cream in a jar was a top seller for Avajar, and so they expanded on the delivery system to include sheet masks. With all that being said, these masks do not come with an LED light (but if you already have one of your own, you could certainly use it with this product). I just wanted to pass this info along to clear up the confusion surrounding the marketing terms used on these masks.<br /><br />For context: My skin is dry and dehydrated, very sensitive and product reactive. I have not experienced any issues from using these masks, outside of some temporary erythemia (a.k.a. skin flushing, which I experience regularly). These masks are formulated without any artificial colors, fragrance, silicons, and parabens. This is not to say these masks are fragrance free, because they absolutely have a scent. The smell is rather herbal to me, which I believe is attributed to fruit and flower essences used in the cream. All Avajar products are made in a cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) certified lab. However, I do not see any claims of cruelty-free status, neither on the package nor on their website.<br /><br />I do self care Sundays every week and will wear a sheet mask for 30 minutes while I relax in bed. Putting this mask on is pretty messy. You'll want to apply it over your bathroom sink because the cream is on the watery side and will drip everywhere. There is a generous amount of the cream essence inside the package and on the mask. The sheet mask material is super thin and hugs the contours of my face well. It's a nice size and sticks well, so you can actually wear one and move about, without having it lift or slide all over. After 30 minutes I peel the mask off and massage the remaining product into my skin. There isn't any stickiness and the cream absorbs nicely. My skin feels baby soft, supple, and deeply moisturized each time I use one. These masks come in a box of 5 and there's 3 formulas to choose from - Hydrating {blue} (which is the one I got), Whitening {yellow}, and Nourishing {red}. I have really enjoyed using these in my weekly sheet masks rotation. The price is extremely reasonable for such great quality. I love the results I've gotten and I recommend them entirely! I just purchased the Nourishing set and will definitely repurchase these hydrating masks when I run out.<br /><br />PRO'S:<br />+ Adds moisture to dry, dehydrated skin<br />+ Soothes and calms skin irritation<br />+ Skin feels soft, supple & deeply nourished after use<br />+ No artificial color, fragrance, silicon, parabens<br />+ Mask material hugs facial contours<br />+ Masks don't slip & slide off the face<br />+ Fast absorption - refreshes in 20-30 minutes<br />+ Comes in a pack of 5 at a cost of $1.55 a piece<br />+ Perfect for a relaxing self care session<br />+ Conveniently shipped on PRIME<br /><br />CONS:<br />- None",B083B67373,1615139298521,5.0
AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,A beautiful assortment of rainbow colors in a variety of finishes! 🌈 Stellar formula!,"If you're looking to build your gel polish collection on a budget, this set of 20 colors from Rosegin has you covered. There's a little bit of everything in this kit - crèmes, full coverage microglitters, jellies, and crelly finishes. They also include a base, as well as glossy and matte no-wipe topcoats (both of which are phenomenal!) The glossy top is super shiny and the matte top looks like velvet.<br /><br />Rosegin curated a lovely rainbow assortment of mini gel colors in this set. You get pastels and primary colors, but no black or white polish is included. The bottles are 5ml; though they look tiny, they're filled to the top and contain enough product for several mani's. I swatched 12 out of the 20 shades in this kit and the formulas are amazing! Smooth and buttery. Beautifully pigmented - 2 coats to full coverage. The glitters aren't thick or clumpy, and don't leave bald spots during application. The brushes fan out nicely on the nail and make the polishes easy to control. There is no offensive odor to any of these and they cured within 60 secs in my LED lamp. I cannot speak to the wear time with these as I always wear a peel-off base or full cover tips with gel polish products.<br /><br />I've shown both the glossy and matte top coats with my swatches. All colors are shown at 2 easy coats. These are fabulous for the price and I wholeheartedly recommend them. I will definitely be checking out other Rosegin products! The colors are gorgeous and the quality is outstanding! Everything in this set comes beautifully boxed - perfect for gifting!",B08K8P7LN6,1610147708045,5.0
AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,"One coat coverage, buttery smooth formulas & special FX finishes! 😍 Amazing set of polishes!","This set of gel polishes from Pine Gel really blew me away! These cover in one easy coat and have a nice glossy finish. The glitter polish was a little bit thick, but it's packed with glitter so I guess that's to be expected. This set of six shades contains (1) Glitter, (3) Crèmes, (2) Magnetics, and a cats eye magnet wand needed to work the magnetic polishes. All of the colors cure for 60 secs in an LED lamp or 90 secs in a UV.<br /><br />The crèmes are all buttery smooth in application, and self level beautifully. Each dry down to a nice glossy finish. The magnetics are easy to manipulate with the enclosed magnet stick. I was able to do a double cat eye line on my first try! (These are gonna be a lot of fun to play with using different shaped magnets for different effects.) Both magnetic polishes covered completely in one easy coat. The glitter shade is jam-packed with small royal blue glitters and is accented with a sprinkling of medium sized blue hexagons. The depth and sparkle to this polish is incredible. The glitter load makes this shade a little bit thick - but it's still workable. None of these gel polishes have a bad odor. None of them gave me any issues during application or the curing process. I cannot speak to the wear time, as I always use a peel-off base coat or full coverage tips, with gel polish products.<br /><br />Because these are so rich in pigment, (and a lot of them are dark colors), it is best to work in thin coats. They do cure with a sticky layer. All of these (except the glitter) cured for 60 sec in my LED lamp. With the thickness and opacity of the glitter polish, I did a double cure on that one to be safe. All swatches in this review are ONE coat and are shown WITHOUT top coat.<br /><br />I think the coverage, formula, and finishes of these polishes is amazing and absolutely worth the price. I highly recommend these! Thanks for reading. :) If my review and photos were helpful to you in any way, please click the button below to let me know. Thanks!",B085TFXLH1,1609995351786,5.0
AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,"Pretty packaging, lovely scent 🌹 The best of Touch in Sol No Poreblem primers in a sample size set","This is a really nice travel sized set of the Touch in Sol No Poreblem primers, which comes in a cute box, suitable for gifting. The products are deluxe sample sizes, which is a perfect way to try out the line and find your favorite. 🌹<br /><br />I will start off with the Priming Water and Priming Essence. Both of these products come in dropper style ampoules. Neither of mine were filled to the top. These bottles are already on the smaller side, so it was especially disappointing to see missing product. For that, I've docked a star. [see photos attached, including one with a nail polish bottle for scale of sizing.]<br /><br />Both the Essence and Water feels like a light oil in texture. They spread easily, absorb quickly, and are meant to be used as the last step in your skin care. The No Poreblem primer in a tube is your silicone based makeup primer. It has that familiar silky finish, and does do a good job of blurring the pores. This is not so much a pore ""filling"" primer; this one works more to smooth them out, and creates a nice base for your foundation.<br /><br />All of the products in this set have a light rose scent, which smells divine. I am not usually fond of most rosy florals because they are always either too strong, smell artificial, or very old lady-ish. This scent is none of those things. Touch in Sol has nailed the rose fragrance - it's lightweight, very fresh, and I really enjoy it. As someone who is skin sensitive to added fragrance, I had zero reactions to any of these products. 🌹",B08F4ZDVZQ,1605898143424,4.0
AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,Transfer resistant formula 😷 with excellent coverage! Unlike any BB cream I've ever tried!,"The Fromnature BB cream by Cosmocos is unlike any beauty balm I've ever tried. It has much better coverage, and a thicker consistency than any other BB's I've used (which, until now, have all been Western brands). It almost covers like a foundation, but feels extremely lightweight like a BB. It does dry down really fast, and it was a bit darker than I expected. I am light neutral in complexion and chose the shade ""light beige"". I believe I was able to make the color work for me, but I'm not sure if it'll suit all light skin tones. 👻<br /><br />This BB has a beautiful satin matte finish, but did have a tendency to cling to my dry patches, so be sure to start with an exfoliated, well moisturized, and primed face. I did not use any primer with this product, (since it's marketed as a BB cream), and without the aid of a pore filling primer this product did eventually settle into my fine lines & large pores. I am really impressed with the staying power of this product though, even without primer & setting spray! After a full day of masking against covid in the South Florida heat, there was no transfer to my face mask. 😃 That's a huge, HUGE plus! With that being said, I highly recommend using a really good cleanser to efficiently remove this product at the end of the day.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Great coverage that can be built up<br />+ Very lightweight on the skin<br />+ Excellent staying power<br />+ SPF 50<br />+ Transfer resistant! 🙌<br />+ No photo flashback!<br />+ Fragrance free!<br />+ 1.67 oz of product (vs. the U.S. standard 1 fl. oz)<br />+ 2 sample hair care products included as a bonus! ❤<br />+ Convenient PRIME Shipping<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Dries very fast and can be difficult to blend<br />- Clings to dry patches<br />- Settles into pores & wrinkles (without primer)<br /><br />TO BE CONSIDERED:<br />* Warm yellow undertone may not suit everyone<br /><br />Side Note: There was one other thing I wanted to mention... When I took the manufacturer safety seal off of the tube, I had a volcanic eruption of BB cream that I wasn't prepared for, which made a mess of my tube. If you're like me and don't want to waste precious product, just be aware that it might come spilling out like lava when you break the product seal. 🙃",B08DXCVRNY,1603747549927,4.0
AHMZDG7TLXFO6H5RPWEX6PX6EN5A,Moisturizing and “plumping” of skin,"This product is quite expensive but it packs a lot of great ingredients. Dr. Denese has a fantastic product line, and I love her magnetic face mask, amongst other things. I didn’t get this product for the anti-aging properties, but more for the moisture and exfoliating base. I use it after I cleanse and tone my face, let it fully absorb for a few minutes, and then apply my serums and/or just moisturizer. When I use it at night I find that my skin feels plumper and moisturized when I wake up. The 2oz bottle can stretch out over a long period of time too, so the product is worth the money, it’s just not quite in my everyday price range. I do like that I can cut out serums at night and still feel like I’m treating my face. I don’t have visible wrinkles yet so I haven’t seen any anti-wrinkle effects, but my skin does feel fuller, if that makes sense. My skin feels tighter in a good way, and my skin looks and feels softer and just overall more even looking.",B07DFNPVSF,1608518363563,4.0
AHMZDG7TLXFO6H5RPWEX6PX6EN5A,Controls frizz w/o adding weight to hair,"The scent is very refreshing and mild, it almost just blends with your shampoo/ conditioner. I spray a few pumps on my hair and smooth it in with a comb, and then let my hair air dry overnight and I’ve noticed a significant difference in frizz control. My hair kinda feels/ looks poofy and frizzy after I wash it and this product tames my hair without weighing it down at all. My hair just feels softer and smoother when I use it, but I don’t feel it in my hair at all, it quickly absorbs. I have long hair and this size is more of a travel size bottle for me, even using just a few pumps every few nights, I’m down to the last bit of product. I will likely order it again because it’s seamless for frizz, and I like how weightless it is.",B07THLR7RR,1608517852718,5.0
AHMZDG7TLXFO6H5RPWEX6PX6EN5A,"Lightweight, compact, easy/ fun to use","This is a decent portable nail lamp. It’s affordable, very lightweight, easy to use, and comes with some accessories and the settings on the lamp are convenient. It takes a bit longer than I was hoping to fully dry, but after about 10 minutes, you’re good to go. I like this because it’s small and light so I can pack it with me anywhere. It is easy to use, and a child could use it (with supervision so they don’t look into the light) because you just slide your hand under the light and it will detect your hand and start the light/ drying process. I have noticed that the lag time seems to be getting longer on the motion detecting light, but it’s not extremely bothersome. Sometimes it takes a few swipes, but it generally works. It’s a great thing to have if you enjoy doing your nails at home, or even just a fun “spa” thing to do with your friends, or kids during winter and/ or quarantine. This is by no means a professional style nail lamp but for the price, it gets the job done.",B085ZRVDKP,1608515987036,4.0

AHMZDG7TLXFO6H5RPWEX6PX6EN5A,Great for a soft clean face & beard,"This face wash is so exfoliating and smells great. It works really well on the beard area and preps the skin for a nice, super smooth shave. It doesn’t seem to strip the face of natural oils, which is great.

AFHB5H6XQKOFLV7JRZUBA6IHJC6A,Met my needs,"These are not the most comfortable to wear and it takes some getting used to. I do not hook them to my mask, I just let them rest on my face under my mask. They don’t help save my makeup but that is not what I use them for. I am a teacher and have a hybrid class (covid times). This means I am teaching in person and my remote students log on at certain times for lessons. So I wear this contraption for 30 minutes at a time. I teach pre k and my mask does not allow children to accurately hear me. I cannot take my mask of because I also have students in person. This bracket allows my young scholars to hear the important sounds during phonics and phonemic learning. It was difficult for my remote students to diffreintiate between sounds when segmenting words such as she, he, etc.",B08FBHNBP1,1619044086818,5.0

AFHB5H6XQKOFLV7JRZUBA6IHJC6A,Great for removing nail glue.,I like to do my own nails. These emery boards are wonderful for removing glue and gel polish.

AFHB5H6XQKOFLV7JRZUBA6IHJC6A,Another great L'ange product!,I've tried a couple L'ange products with the sea salt spray being my favorite. I love this fortifying detangler as well! My hair is fine which means its fragile. I'm trying to grow it out about four more inches. My ends tend to get thin from breakage. I'm hoping this product helps prevent this. So far I notice my hair is breaking less when I brush it. It's a great detangler with a clean scent. It adds shine to my hair and there is less frizz.,B07THLR7RR,1598815971690,5.0
AFHB5H6XQKOFLV7JRZUBA6IHJC6A,Not for combination skin type.,"At 30 something, I wanted to start taking better care of my skin. I was excited to try this Infusion Oil. Many referred to this as the game changer. But sadly this wasn't a product for me. I still have combination and acne prone skin. The oil never soaked into my skin. It also caused me to break out. I gave it to my mother-in-law, she has dry patches. She loved this stuff. It worked perfectly for her. Her face felt refreshed and moisturized. She also has sensitive skin and has not had any irritation from this Infusion Oil.",B07DFNPVSF,1598192646174,3.0

I do my own nails and just find dip to be messy and time consuming. I figured at this point all gel systems were the same, so I’ve been using a cheap brand. I came across this kit and definitely notice the difference in Red Carpet. It’s much better quality. Your gel polish will last 21 days if you follow the directions.

AEE4M36AZAKURLEYGV23TM3BE7OQ,Very Convenient,"These towelettes are great for keeping in your car's glove compartment, putting inside your tote bag, or stashing away in your office desk.  They're very handy for times when you can't get to a sink and use soap and water.  They also smell great.  They're a little pricey for everyday use, so I took off one star for that.",B096S4RQNH,1633993026917,4.0
AEE4M36AZAKURLEYGV23TM3BE7OQ,Good Set,"Avocado oil seems to be good at moisturizing without being greasy.  I have some body lotion with avocado oil and really like that, so I decided to try this shampoo/conditioner set.  It does a very good job of cleaning your hair and leaving it shiny and bouncy.  I still prefer coconut oil for hair, but avocado oil is doing a good job, too.",B08XJWLLKQ,1622837956115,4.0

AEE4M36AZAKURLEYGV23TM3BE7OQ,Very Moisturizing,"This shampoo does an excellent job of moisturizing (and cleaning) your hair.  However, you don't want to use it more than 3-4 times a week, because the castor oil builds up and starts making your hair look greasy.  I alternate it with another shampoo, and it works great that way.",B087ZQG11L,1614466714088,4.0
AEE4M36AZAKURLEYGV23TM3BE7OQ,Okay,"I like the twist towel a lot, but I found the shower-cap-like towel to be a little hard to use.  My hair is below shoulder-length, and it just didn't work well for me.  The twist towel is great, though.  I didn't care for the hair ties and won't be using those.  If you have longer hair and just want some twist towels, I would go with a different product because the cap probably won't work for you.  But if you're hair is shorter, this set would be a pretty good choice.",B0841WQNNZ,1605390263959,4.0
AEE4M36AZAKURLEYGV23TM3BE7OQ,Nice,"This shampoo and conditioner set is very moisturizing, but doesn't leave your hair limp or greasy-looking.  It leaves my fine, shoulder-length hair bouncy and shiny.  The travel size is also very convenient.",B086XH7BWW,1602449679979,5.0
AEE4M36AZAKURLEYGV23TM3BE7OQ,Detangles Well,"This is pretty good.  I was surprised at how well it worked for detangling wet hair.  The scent is also nice -- it does not smell like vinegar.  It does help with frizziness, too, on those really humid days.  It also reduces static electricity in your hair on really dry days.  I would definitely use this again.",B0BG6WX4DH,1549154115618,5.0
AEQ7D7IDDUFNPOL4VDSXWZPIWKUQ,Claw Clips,"Yes! Yes! Yesssss!!<br /><br />Several years ago, my daughter got me hooked on this style of hair clip. Unfortunately, we could only find them at a big-name retailer. And...you could only get a set of three. For hair clips, they weren't cheap. Hello! I found these on Amazon, got triple the clips, and all contained in a plastic box that I use to keep them from breaking during travel. Bonus: these clips aren't as fragile as the others. The clips come in three colors: black, gold, and matte silver. You get two of each color. I have extremely long hair and I wear it up 95% of the time. The clips hold well – wet or dry hair. They're not huge or bulky. I've tried many clips. As for these, they're perfect! Best hair accessory. I don't leave home without one.",B08HMLXW65,1611357625511,5.0
AEQ7D7IDDUFNPOL4VDSXWZPIWKUQ,Eyelash Serum,"I've used an eyelash serum before and had some success with it in the past. Hoping for positive results from BEPHOLAN serum. Ingredients are reported to be natural ingredients such as hydrolyzed oat protein, olive glycerides, and sodium hyaluronate. After doing a bit of online investigation about sodium hyaluronate, there is some indication that it can assist in hair growth. It may moisturize the hair shaft and keep it from breakage. Turns out, it could help hair growth. So, does this apply to eyelashes? Hmm. The serum comes in a mascara tube. Instead of applying with a brush, the serum is applied to the eye with a mascara wand. I've gotta say - I thought this would be better applied to roots, but the serum doesn't seem to adhere to the wand as it would to a small brush-on wand. I have to really dig the wand into the container to get the serum to stick to the applicator. My solution is to use my own small paintbrush. Thankfully, it seems to apply to my lashes much better. I've been using this lash serum for less than a week. I don't normally post reviews until I've had noticeable improvements. The product description says that lashes may show improvement within two weeks. I will post an update in two weeks to a month. I believe consistency is key with most of these products. I use it twice a day on days that I'm on top of my game. It's quick and easy. Most days, though, it's once a day. BEPHOLAN Cosmetics suggests taking a BEFORE and AFTER picture of your lashes. Stay tuned.",B08J7R5HHX,1606859618734,4.0
AEQ7D7IDDUFNPOL4VDSXWZPIWKUQ,Large Bar of Soap,"Thank you, Follain! I could easily get addicted to this large bar of soap. It has a light minty scent. If you're familiar with essential oils, well, it smells lovely. Not overpowering. My husband likes it, too. During my shower, the soap lathered exceptionally well. It rinsed clean and didn't leave that residue that some other soaps leave behind. I felt squeaky clean. Follain gets a ten from me!",B086N136NH,1605124316275,5.0
AEQ7D7IDDUFNPOL4VDSXWZPIWKUQ,MOMENTUM Face Serum,"What woman doesn't love cosmetics and everything that entails? I'm always keeping my eyes open for beneficial face creams and serums. I became obsessed with healthy skin after moving to Puerto Rico. We all of us know about the sun's damaging effects. It's harmful to all skin, not just those with aging skin. Algae can quite possibly reduce the breakdown of hyaluronic acid within the skin. Algae subspecies have anti-aging benefits. Undaria pinnatifida extract is shown to reduce wrinkle depth and improve over-all skin appearance. It also helps to protect the skin's natural stores of collagen and hyaluronic acid. The alteromonas ferment extract is found in deep seawater algae. It has binding properties that help hydration. Salicornia herbacea extract contains good-for-the-skin things – increasing skin barrier and deep hydration. It might even help the skin recover. Caprylic triglyceride reduces dryness and has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal properties. It will not clog pores and is suitable for people with oily skin. Arginine protects the skin from free radicals that contribute to fine lines. Arginine in cosmetics hydrates and boosts collagen production. The parfum ingredient is not damaging to the skin. Maltol and POLYQUATERNIUM-80 (plant-based) is used in cosmetics regularly and deemed safe.  NMF (Natural Moisturizing Factor) components work to keep skin supple and hydrated. The combination of these ingredients is a friend to the skin's health. Understanding what's in our products ensures that we are buying serums we actually want to put on our faces. Knowing all of this, I am 100% satisfied with applying this serum. The smell is reminiscent of cotton candy. It isn't overpowering. In fact, I think it enhances my want to use. It feels indulgent. It smells incredible. It appears to be working well for me. I have nothing to say about this product but great, great things!",B081MQD52C,1604718908541,5.0
AEQ7D7IDDUFNPOL4VDSXWZPIWKUQ,Bouquet Garni Body Shower Gel,"Since COVID, finding soap and shower gels isn't the easiest task. Not sure if people are drinking gels in the shower or just really self-conscious about cleanliness. Either way, I often find myself ordering products online. The selection at physical stores is iffy. Ran across this product and decided to give it a try. After all, the packaging is attractive. If anything it will look nice in a guest bathroom IF I ever have guests at my house again.<br /><br />First, the size is great. Almost 18 ounces! Popular brands offer a hand pump with 7.5 oz. Bouquet Garni is double the size. That's a good thing. Less I've gotta get out. I'm not crazy about the White Musk smell. It's a floral scent. I'm more of a woodsy, fruity scent. On the other hand, my mother loves this scent. So, while I planned to use this as a shower gel, I've decided to use it in the guest bath. Mom can enjoy the rich lather every time she washes her hands.<br /><br />Made in Korea. I'm not sure of the ingredients because the back label is foreign. I'm sure the website offers ingredients if one must know.",B08YJV9YL2,1603223452267,4.0
AEQ7D7IDDUFNPOL4VDSXWZPIWKUQ,Vitamin C Serum,"Not my favorite Vit C serum. While it supplies major moisture, my skin did not appreciate the thickness. When I woke up the first morning after using my face felt greasy. It didn't appear to have that sheer feeling of a clean moisturizer. Afterward, I applied the serum every other night. Four days later, I had breakouts on my nose. I have combination skin. This didn't work well for me, but I can see this working for those with severely dry skin.",B08BZ1RHPS,1603220967018,4.0
AELZIKZNMROP2SMO5XXVB4V36RJA,Feels luxurious but little to no results,"Smells and feels great.  Feels very luxurious. A little goes a long way.

AELZIKZNMROP2SMO5XXVB4V36RJA,Sparkly colors and buildable black,I really can't complain at all about this set.  Colors are very pretty.  Easy to apply and cure.  I love the fact it comes with black polish.  The black is sheer but that is kind of a plus with this set because it allows buildable color.  You may not want a dark black behind the glitter.  A couple of the colors are similar and unless they are side by side it's harder to tell them apart but overall I love it. I really love the fact that I can have beautiful glitter nails without the scratchy feel.  I would order Pine products again.  They don't smell bad either.,B085SY4WC3,1609193770770,5.0
AELZIKZNMROP2SMO5XXVB4V36RJA,"Pots are kinda messy. No base, top coat or brush.  Glitter is pretty.","You will need base and top coat and a scooper/brush tool. They are not included. It took 3 coats of the black polish (included) to get full, dark coverage.  The pots are messy to open and quite small, but colors are pretty and sparkly.  Lots of glitter effect with multiple coats.  You will need a brush as well.  The finish feels bumpy (you can feel the glitter).  Maybe multiple top coat would help but I didn't want more layers since I already had base, 3 layers of color, 2 layers of glitter and a top coat.",B086W18W1W,1598567167869,3.0
AELZIKZNMROP2SMO5XXVB4V36RJA,Not exactly a starter kit,"The light is small and shallow. Thumb has to cure separately.  This ""complete"" kit is not exactly complete. It has a micro USB cord but no box. Very basic nstructions. No times noted for curing. No color included.  Assuming I cured for the correct time, I had a couple nails that smudged off when I wiped with alcohol.  Most didn't. Top coat is exceptionally shiny.  I have other Red Carpet items that I'm quite pleased with. This kit fell a bit short on expectations. As a starter kit, it's one you'll have to add a few things to (file, USB box, nail color, etc.) so be aware of that.  The Purify cleaner has a light scent, but is a small bottle. I like the top coat.  Kit is decent but not great.",B0BC273JJR,1597593538002,3.0
AELZIKZNMROP2SMO5XXVB4V36RJA,It's quiet.  Not super powerful,"I do like that the 3 different grit rollers can be flipped right on the head.  It is quiet. I charged it several hours before using it, but it began lagging quickly.  I plugged it in and kept using it and didn't notice much difference while plugged in.  The description recommend only use 2 or 3 seconds at a time but I didn't find any reason why it would say that.  It wasn't very powerful, but I did see a considerable amount of very fine skin.  It didn't collect in the little tray that I could tell.  It claims to work wet or dry.  I will leave the wet testing to someone with less candles on their cake than I.  My feet felt better after using.<br />I believe there are better ones than this at a competitive price point.  It did work so I have to give it at least 3 ☆☆☆.  It was quiet so that's a plus.  The charge cord is very short.",B08BRS98SF,1595997571540,3.0
AFESFBY7EYJMQNKR572SZFAAET5Q,Expensive,"I have been using this device for a full three months. I can honestly say that I don’t think it’s made a whole lot of difference in my under eye area.<br /><br />The device is easy to use and has different levels. It holds a charge very well. Occasionally I would get a little “zap” but it wasn’t anything super painful.<br /><br />This device is pretty expensive. Weighing the cost versus the results, I personally wouldn’t buy this again.",B08P2DZB4X,1628864954140,3.0
AFESFBY7EYJMQNKR572SZFAAET5Q,Great gift,These are very cute scrunchies for a bridesmaid gift. The pack comes with 6 pink and 1 white. It’s a shiny material and looks pretty. These would be great in a proposal box or for the wedding.,B08YNR839W,1620580835851,4.0
AFESFBY7EYJMQNKR572SZFAAET5Q,7 masks,"This is a really fun set and would make a good gift. It comes with 7 masks and lists what order to use them in. Varies from hydrating, brightening to clarifying masks.<br /><br />These are all cloth masks and easy to use. After the week my skin did feel very well hydrated. This is a bit expensive for what it is, but is a fun splurge.",B08GYJY8F2,1606683181978,4.0
AFESFBY7EYJMQNKR572SZFAAET5Q,Value pack,"I’ve used this brand for years so I was excited to find this value pack! The packaging is beautiful and could make a nice Christmas gift.

This is an excellent value.",B08H4SYXR4,1604869575656,5.0
AFESFBY7EYJMQNKR572SZFAAET5Q,Not thick enough,"This has a great smell but I found the product was too thin for my damaged hair. I prefer a thicker hair cream spray.  If you’re looking for a very light spray, you may enjoy this product.",B07THLR7RR,1598286232535,3.0
AFESFBY7EYJMQNKR572SZFAAET5Q,Would repurchase!,"I really like this face wash. I've used it just in my hands to wash my face really quickly, and I've also used it with my facial cleansing brush to get a deeper clean. It smells amazing. It has a thicker consistency and lathers, which I really like because it makes my face feel extra clean. Would buy this again!",B07ZQRX7FX,1598014153777,5.0
AFESFBY7EYJMQNKR572SZFAAET5Q,Favorite,"I am a big fan of caudalie products. This is a mini size kit and is perfect for travel. There are five products in this kit. I have sensitive skin and I always trust caudalie! Plus, the products always have a pleasant smell.",B085NYYLQ8,1597526184995,5.0
AF2AJZ2KIDH4QJSOXBKCFGAZITGA,"Great packaging, no results so far though","I really like this roller... it is so convenient and easy to apply (and also feels good doing it).  I appreciate that I have had no skin sensitivity, and there is no aroma at all (which is important to me because I wear contacts and often a scent will irritate my eyes - no problem with this serum).  The ingredients seem relatively standard other than the addition of caffeine.  While I like the roller and packaging and the way this feels when applying, I am not noticing any results.  The serum applies *very* thinly... you can barely tell anything has come out of the roller at all.  Because I didn’t experience any effect I thought that maybe the issue was a lack of serum actually being applied and so I started applying it more frequently, and still no noticeable effect for me.  It does provide some moisturization, without leaving a sheen, but doesn’t work as well as another serum that I have used (which also has a very similar roller type application).  I will continue to use it and maybe the results are just delayed... if so I will update the review.  Hope this is helpful to you...",B0B8SFDJN9,1615650299739,3.0
AF2AJZ2KIDH4QJSOXBKCFGAZITGA,Excellent quality on all components,"These amber glass bottles, and included components, are of excellent quality.  I have ordered glass bottles in the past and while the bottles themselves were always okay, the sprayer was often inferior (plus they usually don’t have the other components such as labels, funnel, marking pen, caps).  The glass bottles are great, gorgeous color and sturdy glass.  Colored bottles are needed for certain liquids (peroxide, for example, always comes in an amber/brown container to protect it from light).  The sprayer is high quality and is sturdy.  The spray action is also great - you can set it on mist or stream.  As I noted, the sprayer has been my downfall on previous bottle purchases, so I am happy to see that the sprayers on these are top notch.  You also get two screw on caps in case you don’t want to use the sprayer (or need to transport them and are concerned about leakage).  It also includes 4 labels and a white marking pen, as well as a small stainless steel funnel.  Every component included in the set is top notch, and the totality of the package makes it an excellent value.  I will also note that the bottles and components were very well packaged to protect them during the shipping process.  Overall a definite winner.  Hope this review is helpful to you!",B08HGZXLP6,1612621464548,5.0
AF2AJZ2KIDH4QJSOXBKCFGAZITGA,"Excellent quality glass, ok nozzle, great color","The glass bottles are top notch - the glass is nice and thick, and the color is beautiful.  The ‘look’ of the bottle is so nice that it actually looks good sitting around anywhere (i.e. you don’t feel the need to hide it in a cabinet, under the counter, etc.).  The nozzle is ok.  It works well, and looks nice with the glass, but doesn’t feel particularly sturdy.  Having said that, it is far better than some others I have had where the nozzle sort of swiveled around while you were attempting to spray (VERY annoying).  There are two settings - a fine mist and a more narrow spray/mist.  Between the two settings you should be able to get the spray you want/need.  It also comes with nice blackboard style labels, two small funnels, and two screw on caps.  The caps are nice in case you want to better seal the contents for some reason - for example, if it won’t be in use for a while, packing it for a trip, etc.  Colored glass is needed for a number of liquids that you might have - peroxide, for example, or an essential oil blend.  The blue in these bottles is just really beautiful, and combined with the black sprayer, creates an attractive bottle so you will be pleased with both the functionality as well as the look.  This is the reason I chose these bottles because I use one of them to mix up a ‘spider repellent’ spray (water, peppermint oil, and a couple of drops of dish detergent), and it stays on the screened in porch.  Hope this review helps you!",B089ZQ8Y95,1601125786051,4.0
AF2AJZ2KIDH4QJSOXBKCFGAZITGA,"Glass bottle is top notch, sprayer is not","I got these to put water/vinegar mixture in one and alcohol in the other, to use for cleaning and disinfecting purposes, respectively.  I wanted glass, rather than plastic, for these purposes.  The bottles themselves are top notch - heavy duty glass, nice size that is easy to hold yet doesn’t require constant refilling.  There are two included cap tops which are also nice - leak-proof if you want to store something in them that you either don’t need the sprayer for, OR, are transporting them somewhere and want to make sure no spillage.  The sprayer on the other hand, is not so great.  I do like that the sprayer tube is extra long... meaning you can get down to the last few drops.  But it feels cheap overall.  Other problems with the sprayer:  the screw on top fits pretty firmly, but the nozzle does not stay in place - it sort of swivels around.  This gets to be annoying if you are squirting multiple squirts because the nozzle keeps shifting.  The other thing that might be an issue for some is that there are only two settings and they are BOTH mist settings.  It appears that one is a slightly finer mist than the other (barely) but I am not 100% sure that is even the case.  This is not a problem for me because of the purpose I am using them... but wanted to point this out in case it might be a problem for others.  Overall the glass bottles are great but the nozzles need some work.  It also comes with 4 black labels - the labels actually are sort of a thin rubbery material and seem really nice... but what the heck am I going to use to write on BLACK labels?",B089CSR3KF,1598566298759,3.0
AF2AJZ2KIDH4QJSOXBKCFGAZITGA,10” by 15” - larger size wipes,"These wipes are pretty good (albeit expensive).  I like that they are larger (10”x15”) and individually wrapped, which makes carrying them with you easier.  These would be great to take along on a hiking or camping trip, or any time you might want to wipe down your whole body.  I do NOT understand why the ad, pictures, description or box doesn’t include the size of the item - I find that oddly curious.  They have an interesting scent that I suspect some people may not like.  It is the chaparral scent which can smell a little ‘chemically’.  It isn’t bad but it *is* a somewhat unusual scent. After wiping down the scent does linger for a while, albeit somewhat lighter.  The wipes seem to have a lot of wiping power... it seemed that the moisture just remained as I wiped down most of my body.  They don’t feel any more moist than other wipes do, but it seems that the moisture goes a longer way.  Overall a very good product that is a little pricey, but does offer a nice convenience factor.",B09L33VJCL,1596120146707,4.0

AHVS5I6ROMNPROYEMWTCCLR6WP6A,Obsessed with this serum,"I am a lover of high quality face serums because they soak into your skin without leaving you greasy like oils or lotions but unfortunately not all serums Are created equal. Some are packed with cheap oils and don’t truly work, well Not this one!!! This one is everything! I put it on all over my face, neck and especially under my eyes (which is my trouble spot because of little wrinkles) and this soaks in so beautiful. It hydrated that area so my makeup goes on like butter! It is a very light fresh smell- I almost don’t smell anything- which is perfect because my eyes can water so easy but not with this serum!<br />It’s vegan friendly too!<br />Manila serum is a must have in my morning routine.",B081MQD52C,1603453208291,5.0
AHVS5I6ROMNPROYEMWTCCLR6WP6A,Perfect kit for my touch ups,[[VIDEOID:e63684315904fe3d7cd3092a12671e7d]] This is a great kit for my household. We do touch ups in between our appointments. The cape is thin and has small ties in the back but works perfect for both my husband and I. The scissors are a little bigger so for my smaller hands I could use a little bit smaller pair but it does the trick. I also have used the cape when I dye my roots and it works great to keep me protected.,B088PYN4VM,1600161811349,5.0
AGK5FHPJXPI75CVFCUKFFKLIF3VQ,So/so for a 3 year old,My 3 year old niece has baby hairs that drive her crazy and I wanted to get something to help combat the dreaded tint hairs in the front of her face. These do the job and stay on pretty nicely but my niece complains that it bothers her behind her ears and she takes it off after about an hour give or take. Now shes never worn headbands like these so I think it will be something she has to get used to and that it's not the product that is the problem. They're cute and get the job done.,B08QHP717Z,1618829371399,4.0
AGK5FHPJXPI75CVFCUKFFKLIF3VQ,Overall I like these,"These have me conflicted on whether I like them or not. They are pretty (at least the darker solids, I threw the other ones away as I'll never use them) and they are a soft velvet and do have button for your mask loops to hook on to. That was the main reason I ordered these because I'm tired of my ears getting sore being in the medical field having to wear a mask for over 8 hours at a time. I do feel lole the velvet helps it stay in place more than the regular cotton or polyester ones but velvet is thick and makes me sweat. Not only that but the way the headband is designed there isnt much stitching to hold the buttons in the position you need them to be in order to hook your mask on. It rolls back on my scalp and then the buttons can get caught in my hair so I have to slide it forward and fidget with it a bit to get it right but for the entirety of my shift I did keep it on and it kept my mask in place comfortably with no problem. I wish the design was a bit different and the velvet maybe a little bit thinner but overall I like these.",B08PTZL95G,1611346576826,3.0
AGK5FHPJXPI75CVFCUKFFKLIF3VQ,Beautiful,"The quality of this gel nail polish is great but I believe there should be some sort of instruction booklet or informational guide on how these polishes work. If I didnt go back and look at the amazon listing I wouldnt have known that these can be used in 2 majorly different ways. With the gel by itself, no black underneath, these are very bright and vibrant colors. When the black is underneath them, boy are they worth every penny. They really do come out beautiful with the sparkles and shine, it is almost like a galaxy in each one of your finger nails. It does take a lot of work, but it is worth it. One thing worth mentioning is that you really need to have a solid black coat in order for the color to look good, 2+ coats for black needed!",B085SY4WC3,1608968373823,5.0
AGK5FHPJXPI75CVFCUKFFKLIF3VQ,Great buy!,This is a great set that is actually underpriced for once! The leather case alone is worth half the price and all of the tools are high quality and work very well. Great to carry with me in my car or purse.,B08C2T24WG,1607580883126,5.0
AGK5FHPJXPI75CVFCUKFFKLIF3VQ,A new favorite!,"These masks are one of my new favorites. Normally masks claim to do a lot and often I'm left let down, that was not the case with this mask. These have a TON of moisture/liquid/balm whatever youd like to call it. I was able to apply it to my face, and it was completely saturated so I decided to rub a good amount on my neck, and then once getting it in place I rubbed it into my hands. The serum I rubbed down my neck did dry a lot faster and got sticky in the crease of my neck. I left it on for 25 minutes and it absorbed extremely well. My face is so hydrated without feeling oily. It was so refreshing while I had it on, it was cooling and helped me relax. The directions say to rub the remaining serum in after you take the mask off, which I did. But it was too much serum to leave on and I felt sticky. So I wet my face and wiped the excess with a towel. The only complaint I have is that the mask is weirdly thin and I had a hard time placing it on my face correctly. The eye holes were hardly big enough and it got my lips wet. I think this has to do with how I put it on but I think they could still be a little bit larger in diameter.",B08GJJ5RV9,1604812373776,4.0
AGK5FHPJXPI75CVFCUKFFKLIF3VQ,Not worth the mess,"My first complaint with this argan oil is the fact that it came in the box leaking as soon as it arrived. They wrap it in a plastic bag for this reason to prevent the oil from leaking out but it still leaked through anyhow. There was at least half an inch of oil missing from the top of the bottle from leakage during commute/delivery. Second complaint is the fact that it really didnt work. Because of the benefits of argan oil with hair, I decided to use this as a mask/soak on my hair from root to tip. I have very thick and pretty long hair and I used the entire bottle to cover my head. I covered my head with a plastic shower cap and sat with it on for over an hour. I showered, shampooed twice and conditioned per usual. I really expected a big difference in the amount of frizz, softness, and shininess of my hair.. and I was highly disappointed. It really didnt tame my frizz at all, made it a slight bit softer and isnt shiny at all. Big let down.",B00O2FGBJS,1599712288573,2.0
AGK5FHPJXPI75CVFCUKFFKLIF3VQ,Past the expiration date,These were sent to me relatively quickly and I was excited to use them. But as soon as I checked out the packaging i realized they were expired. They had an expiration date of 05/03/2020 which has clearly already passed. Not very happy.,B08BS3WDPJ,1599105211445,1.0
AGK5FHPJXPI75CVFCUKFFKLIF3VQ,I wouldnt repurchase,This is another product that I feel unsure about the final results. I have long thick coarse curly hair that fizzes very easily and immediately after every shower if I dont use a product in it. I used this before I used any other products but it did not detangle my hair very much compared to how it normally is. I still had to pull through quite a few knots but it didnt seem to take as many pulls to get through them as it normslly does. So I guess that would be considered an improvement. I feel like my hair is volumized and softer with about 5-7 sprays throughout my entire head of hair. This is a thin spray so it is very lightweight and has the consistency similar to water so I dont feel like my hair is at all greasy from this. I used a curl definer like I always do after showers that helps deter the frizz and keep my curls bouncy and it worked well with it. I dont think this product is worth the money for what little it does do. I wouldnt repurchase.,B07THLR7RR,1598375644726,3.0
AGK5FHPJXPI75CVFCUKFFKLIF3VQ,I dont recommend these nails unless you have no other options,"These nails are beautiful for a french manicure but they ended up looking absolutely terrible after applying. I noticed while the nails were still in the package that they had odd chinese like symbols in the glue. I figured it might go away once I put them on but for some of them it didnt. It actually made it look worse and scratchy/bubbly underneath. These ""symbols"" should definitely get removed. I'm not one who does my nails often at all so I'm pretty critical of these. I included pictures of the flaws for others to see.<br /><br />Edit: I peeled these off the next day because of how bubbly and gross they looked underneath. They never dried overnight even after sleeping and still moved around when I tried to move them up and down and back and forth. I dont recommend these nails unless you have no other options.",B088M5P8FN,1596177485467,2.0
AGNP7WAB6CTY72PMMJZTE2DABPPA,Not that effective,"I didn't like this natural nail polish. It took much more scrubbing and nail pads to remove my nail polish. I also did not like the smell. My nails and nail beds felt very greasy after using this. I liked the dispenser, but I would not get this again.",B08NC4378M,1620000101450,3.0
AGNP7WAB6CTY72PMMJZTE2DABPPA,Well made,I was really happy with the performance of this scrunchie stand. It's well made and it holds a lot of scrunchies. I also really like the scrunchies that came with the stand. This would make a perfect gift for anyone that needs an easy way to store scrunchies and hairties.,B08S3B8Y5G,1619987881368,5.0
AGNP7WAB6CTY72PMMJZTE2DABPPA,Obsessed,"I absolutely love this little facial steamer. It's a great size, and heats up the water very quickly. I also like the tools that this comes with. I feel like the headband is a touch too small for my head, but it is very cute. After using it, my skin felt hydrated, and it really opened up my pores. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I wish the cord was a bit longer and thinner. I have to use an extension cord to use it at my makeup desk.",B08P4YQ3K5,1614813228733,4.0
AGNP7WAB6CTY72PMMJZTE2DABPPA,Underwhelming,"I was expecting some larger bubbles than this mask gave me. I kept it on a bit longer than the recommended 3 minutes to see if the bubbles would get any larger, but they didn't. I think it worked well, but I think that the gimmick isn't worth what you get. My face felt pretty good afterward, but it wasn't anything special. This may be cooler to a younger demographic, but I would not get this again.",B08GS1G9BH,1610911848313,4.0
AGNP7WAB6CTY72PMMJZTE2DABPPA,Did not work,"I have tried and tried again for this to work, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to use this. I have watched videos, tutorials, and spent hours trying these plates to get something, but I can't figure it out. I used different types of nail polishes, waited different amounts of times, and even used a stamper from another set (that also doesn't work) and the nail polish does not go onto the stamper. I feel like I see a lot of videos online of these working, but this is my second set and my second try, and it still does not work for me.",B08G4Y4SFV,1609086962376,1.0
AGNP7WAB6CTY72PMMJZTE2DABPPA,LOVE THIS,"I am really impressed with this scrunchie. I have tried to use the invisibobble before, but I have very curly hair and my hair would always get caught in them, even if it did hold my hair up all day. I was so excited to give this a try. It is my new favorite hair accessory. The velvet is very smooth and it grips onto my hair all day. When I take it down, I don't have a very noticeable crease, and it also doesn't tear my hair out. I wish I had 100 of these in every color, I'm now a fan!",B08HXQ3T9K,1607987199867,5.0
AGNP7WAB6CTY72PMMJZTE2DABPPA,"Smells Great, Good Foaming","I have been enjoying this body foam. The smell isn't too overwhelming, and honestly I could use a bit more smell. It foams up really well, and glides on the skin. You can use not a lot and still cover your entire body. It washes off nicely, and you don't really smell it afterward. I have been using this for about a week and the container hasn't rusted or anything either, which is something that tends to happen with products in a metal container. I wish there was a way to know how much was left, so I know when to get a new one, but overall I am happy with this body wash.",B08KGVBW41,1607275147391,5.0
AGNP7WAB6CTY72PMMJZTE2DABPPA,Smells Great!,"This body wash is very potent and smells great. The pump is easy to use and my skin feels great after using it. There is also a lot of product in this, so I will be getting a lot of use out of it.<br /><br />This came arrived and the safety cap was cracked, so it leaked out of the top and was a bit of a mess to clean up. There wasn't too much of product loss, but it still was annoying to clean up.",B08YJV9YL2,1604675616267,4.0
AGNP7WAB6CTY72PMMJZTE2DABPPA,Love the pump,"I love the pump that this shampoo comes with. It's great to easily add the product to your hand while showering. This is also a nice big size for the price.<br /><br />The shampoo is a bit watery, but it does lather very nicely and my hair feels smooth and silky after using it. I feel like I can use this everyday without drying out my hair. The shampoo smells really nice and I love the scent - it's not too strong. I had to use maybe two pumps to fully cover my hair while showering.",B087ZQK2G8,1599766693769,4.0
AGNP7WAB6CTY72PMMJZTE2DABPPA,Quality!,"WOW! I was so surprised when I took these out of the package. They are very sturdy and look amazing. I wasn't expecting them to be as heavy as they were, but they really are pieces of art. There were a few loose hairs, but once those fell out (as most brushes do), they worked great. The carrying case they came with was also very cute. These are perfect for any Harry Potter fan. I am still so happy with how great these are.",B07YG4PRTN,1596564742453,5.0
AH4PCTM7BHVUX6WCGJB5PNS6K3JQ,Highly Moisturizing and Very Lightweight,The best thing about this lotion is it does last for long time. It make my skin very moisturized and hydrated. My skin looks pretty much healthier after using the lotion. I need just a bit to cover my face. It is very lightweight which I really like. All the ingredients inside this lotion helps my skin to be softer and even brighter.,B07RBSLNFR,1625799822948,5.0
AH4PCTM7BHVUX6WCGJB5PNS6K3JQ,Makes the skin hydrated as well as Soothes the sinuses,"[[VIDEOID:3ea33c1e85d8d1a8ce0fd7987edd95af]] This facial steamer heats up very fast (in 30 seconds as stated in the manual) and is very easy to use. You just add some distilled water or purified water and turn the steamer on. Since the steam is hot, you need to make sure that your face is away enough from the nozzle. I like how the steam comes from in a direction that covers the chin and the face. There is no option for adjusting the level of the mist but I do not think if it is necessary since the amount of steam is good in this device. There is a manual inside the package that I found really helpful. The water tank is small and for me, the tank size is holding the exact amount of water I need for each usage.<br /><br />The steamer can be used for hydrating the skin. It also opens the pores and is good for deep cleaning. But the thing I really enjoy while using this steamer is that it is very helpful for my Sinusitis. The warm mist soothes and moisturizes my sinus passageway. So, for me, it does not only make my skin hydrated but also unblocking my sinuses.<br /><br />I also like the portable facial steamer. It is chargeable which is great. It is not that much powerful and it is releasing cold mist but, it is a good size for travel. Surprisingly, this tiny humidifier works for about 10-15 minutes. The other things in the package are also useful to have a nice Spa at home.<br /><br />All in all, I like the whole set and to me, each part of this package is useful and works great.",B08P4YQ3K5,1622518589446,5.0
AH4PCTM7BHVUX6WCGJB5PNS6K3JQ,Men's facial moisturizer with new ingredients!,"This facial moisturizer from Gentlehomme is a combination of effective ingredients for revitalizing, rejuvenating, and hydrating men's skin. Collagen and other herbal oils in this lotion are effective ingredients for reducing redness and long-lasting moisturizing. The cream has a medium thickness and absorption rate. It takes a while to be completely absorbed on my skin and it does not keep any residue on my face. However, it has a long-lasting effect which I can feel for a few hours. My skin becomes smoother when I use it once a day. The cream has a gentle scent. Although I feel some minor burning or stinging at the moment I apply the cream on my dry skin, the feeling fades away after a few minutes. I am also not sure about the impacts of stem cells on my skin yet, as I may need to use it for a longer time to see the promised positive effects on skin wrinkles and dark spots. Lastly, the cream is ordered by Gentelhomme (USA), but it is Made in China, which I was not expected initially, although I liked the quality and hydration performance on my skin.",B0851QJPZY,1603259229248,4.0
AH4PCTM7BHVUX6WCGJB5PNS6K3JQ,An organic hydration face oil with essential ingredients!,"The Laloirelle Deep Hydration Face Oil is a combination of many herbal ingredients and oils which are beneficial for skin moisturizing and rejuvenating. I am not sure whether having all these ingredients in one single bottle can be effective in deep hydration of the skin and/or taking full advantage of each ingredient or not, but I noticed long-lasting hydration from this oil on my skin, especially when I use 3-5 drops 1-2 hour(s) before going to bed. The oil has a nice and relaxing smell and does not have any triggering ingredients for my sensitive skin. The combination of red ginseng and Shiitake mushrooms is great for soothing my dry skin and repairing the effects of sunburns.<br /><br />My only concerns with the current facial oil are its slow adsorption and also the price. The oil sits on my skin for about two hours until it absorbs completely. So, I have to use it only at night. I have seen a faster absorption rate for other facial oils that I have used so far. This can be due to the different oil combinations in this product.  Another issue is its relatively higher price compared with similar products in the market.<br /><br />Other than these two concerns, the Laloirelle Deep Face Oil can be a great choice for repairing, moisturizing, and rejuvenation of dry and dehydrated skins and has long-lasting hydration on the skin.",B08DXZ5VXB,1602636013668,4.0

It also makes my skin calm and soft and looks less tired. It is not oily at all on me (my skin is a bit dry) but gives my skin good hydration for a while (around 12 h for me). It has a natural scent but the scent is intense which I like it but if you have an allergy or do not like the scent, maybe it is not for you. I add just some drops on my clean skin and it covers my face well. Overall, I am happy with this product. :)",B08BZ1RHPS,1599746839441,5.0

AE53TOMIUB7ENP3RD44KDAARU6AQ,Clear and no scent,"This serum is clear and has no scent and I've had no adverse reactions when using it. The little roller ball sometimes gets stuck which then stops the serum from going on to my skin. It's easy enough to get it to roll, but it's still a bit annoying. I can't say that there is a pronounced difference when using this serum but it does feel cool and refreshing when going on.

There's a lot of product in these packets so I tend to scoop out the extra after putting the mask on and putting it over my chest, elbows, and knees. After doing a treatment, the skin on my face looks lifted and feels especially hydrated. I've had no adverse reactions to using these masks. I like to use them just before bed so that I let the product continue to seep in while I'm sleeping. Also, I have a larger face and this particular brand covers more of my face than most.

There is the lightest of scent which is more of a clean smell that hasn't bothered me at all. I've had no adverse skin reactions to the product. I like the shape of the tube as it makes it easy to squeeze out product verses when something comes in a bottle. My skin definitely feels lifted after using it and overall I've been pleased.,B088GWCVVJ,1603398146888,5.0
AE53TOMIUB7ENP3RD44KDAARU6AQ,Strong scrub,"I like this scrub and a little goes a long way. The consistency is that of a concentrated paste and I usually wet my hands first in order to loosen the product up a bit. I've been combining it with another facial cleanser that I like in order to get the best of both a moisturizing cleanser and the scrubbing nature of this product.<br /><br />I've had no adverse reactions from using it and it does an excellent job of polishing and exfoliating my skin. I also can't detect any scent from it, which is good.",B07MMW5654,1597076392880,5.0

I used it to remove all the hard dead skin around my nails which has been built up for some time! I also used it to remove the work out dead skin I had on the inside of my hands! Made them soft and smooth again!! I used the grinder piece to remove some dead skin on my feet as well!

AFEFRMJ5OQHPKVHB3YSZXIS7V4CQ,Decent scissors and hair clips,"Overall, I would say that out of this small hair cutting package only the scissors, thinning shears, and hair clips are decent quality. The scissors are made out of stainless steel but when using them you will notice that they wont cut as smoothly compared to more expensive higher quality scissors. The shears worked perfectly fine for me and they did the job well.<br /><br />Everything else provided in the package is more like the 3 star hotel freebies that are cheap and poorly made.

AFEFRMJ5OQHPKVHB3YSZXIS7V4CQ,Great cleansing cloth that is biodegradable!,"Going on those long hiking trips you always dread the smell you carry on the way back and wish there was a convenient way to clean yourself up. With the Allez outdoor cleansing cloths I would say that your problems are solved!<br /><br />The individually packed cloths fold out to a large size and retains moisture while being used heavily. I've used one wipe to clean my face, arms, legs, and back and there's still a good portion of moisture left on the wipe. In addition, with a nice scent to the wipe you feel really refreshed and clean after using them which is an amazing plus. I would say the best thing about these cloths compared to others is that they are well made and don't break apart after using them vigorously.<br /><br />Overall, going hiking and staying outdoors this item should become an essential item in your pack!",B09L33VJCL,1595722156139,5.0
AEK3IYABOEGTXOTX7P6SBQJUP57A,its not really the right size for a cat,id say this is more of a dog brush than a cat brush b/c of its size.  its actually quite large for even my sisters 3 super fat cats.  I always feel nervous about using a wire brush on a cat b/c they are notorious for always trying to bite the brush or rub their face on it.  im always so concerned about poking them in the eye.  all that being said... she LOVED the self cleaning feature of this brush.  I thought the button was just a press and release and the spikes would just keep popping up.  no... u press the button up and it holds it in place while the bristles disappear.  u then move ur finger over the button towards u and the button releases and the bristles pop out again.  I would say that the brush feels quite bulky in my larger girly hand.  my sister was concerned that the button would break over not that much time.  my vote is to use this specifically for a dog and buy a smaller brush with the same concept for a cat.  I hope this was helpful.,B08KY7VYDS,1614171379929,4.0
AEK3IYABOEGTXOTX7P6SBQJUP57A,not his favorite,"ive ordered a lot of soap from amazon to try.  my boyfriend LOVES expensive soaps!  usually I fill his stocking with them, but this year I filled it with special salts instead.  I thought he was going to love these small travel sized soap that come 6 in a resealable bag, but they fell short of his expectations.  he hated the scent!  the clove smell was just to overpowering.  each bar fits nicely in ur hand b/c they r teardrop shaped and at 1 st they r a little gritty.  it has a cross stamped in it and it really feels more like a guest hand washing soap or something u would get for free at a hotel.  thats about the thickness of each bar.  its handmade here in the USA (which I love) in Ohio and it does leave ur skin feeling moisturized, even though it doesnt lather much.  we r going to move the rest of the bars of soap to our guest bathroom for hand washing only.  I hope this was helpful.",B086TS3BKQ,1609616393264,3.0
AEK3IYABOEGTXOTX7P6SBQJUP57A,foam?  what foam?,"let me start by saying I removed 1 star b/c I had to go back and check the product I ordered vs what I put on my face last night.  the name and the description on the website is nowhere near what I applied to my face in the shower.  it says its a foam and it shows a girls hand with a bubbly foam gently resting in her palm.  that wasnt my experience.  I entered a wrestling match the minute I stepped into my shower.  the stuff was very difficult to get out of the tube.  it has a hint of a suntan lotion smell, which was very nice.  it comes out in a tight, white string into ur hand... and it goes on and stays on like lotion!!!  where's the foam?  where's the bubbles?  I dont know but they didnt attend the party at my shower last night.  with all that being said about the misleading product name and page, the product works.  my face was very clean and not over dried at all.  it does mention that its an exfoliator, but it is a creamy substance with no sand or beads inside.  again, this product does a great job of cleansing ur skin, but dont be surprised when u dont get any bubbles or foam in ur hand.<br />UPDATE:<br />after using it all week I have noticed that there are a couple of tiny beads floating around in the lotion to make its claim as an exfoliator.  I wouldnt say there r a lot in it, but they r in the product.  I hope this was helpful.",B07YS9W97B,1609247318016,4.0
AEK3IYABOEGTXOTX7P6SBQJUP57A,I guess it depends on what u wanna do with it.,"10 for $12 is... well lets face it... is pricey.  if u r looking to use this like a wet one at a restaurant or after touching money... u R NOT GOING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.  if u r going to use it as intended... for ""freshening up"" u might purchase these overpriced wipes.  the package talks about eco friendly and being compostable, but really these things just mean more expensive for the consumer.  its like what the lady at Toyota said to me.  there r 2 types of people who the buy Prius.  ones who only want to save money on gas and the ones who dont care how much something costs as long as its for the environment.  thats how this wipe makes me feel.<br />the consistency of the wipe is soft and WAY thicker then a wet one, but size wise... its about the same.  its definitely not big enough to do ur whole body and it certainly isn't wet enough to even try.  u would have to pick and choose the places u would need it most.  it says that its unscented... but apparently unscented has a scent.  my friend and I wiped our hands last night and decided we hated the scent.  I do like the packaging.  its nice and bright and easy to find at the bottom of ur purse.  I think the box it comes in is a waste of money on the company's end.  its a cube that measures about 3.75"" x 3.5"" x 4.25"".  it has 10 yes 10 prepackaged wipes inside.  they could have easily been compressed down to a smaller package, which would in turn made it more eco friendly.  so in conclusion, im a Prius owner who only cares about the price of gasoline, and these r just way to expensive for me to actually purchase... especially during a pandemic where people r loosing their jobs left and right.

AEZG2W4TRMMNFFAWS2BPQE676K4Q,"Pretty Simple To Use, Stings A Little, No Issues So Far, Awaiting Potential Results","So far, I have no real complaints about this NIRA Skincare Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum Bundle. I’m still at the point where I’m not sure if I can say it truly works because I need to use it for a longer period of time, but I’ll discuss various aspects about the product that will hopefully help with your decision-making.<br /><br />-Came well-packaged in a small, but sturdy cardboard box. Everything arrived intact. I have continued to use this box for storage of the product.<br />-Comes with the handheld laser device, charger with base to plug into an outlet, and manual<br />-No complaints about the battery life so far<br />-Simple to use: there are two buttons: The power button that turns the device on. Then you can press it to cycle through the various levels of intensity 1-5 which are clearly shown using green light bars. You can then hold the power button down to turn the device off again. The top button can be pressed to activate the laser after you have chosen the level of intensity you want.<br />-The laser only works if positioned correctly over an area of skin. It will give a single negative sounding beep if not positioned correctly, and a positive sounding double beep if it is positioned correctly as the laser works. You wait to move the device to the next area after you hear that second beep indicating that it is finished with that laser sequence<br />-The device has a white, plastic outer shell. It is lightweight while still feeling sturdy and durable. I would still be very careful not to drop this as I’m not sure how it could handle a fall<br />-I would recommend experimenting on the lower intensity settings. The undereye area is pretty sensitive. I feel I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but my eyes often still tear up after using per instructions on the highest settings of 4 and 5. For whatever reason, my left eye is much more sensitive to this.<br />-I don’t want to say it is truly painful, but I suppose the best way to describe the sensation is almost similar to if you were being stung by a rubber band that you pulled back and let hit your skin if that makes sense. It isn’t comfortable, but you do get more used to this and can work your way up to a higher level of intensity. You will probably also feel some warmth on the skin after using.<br />-I know this is marketed for under the eyes, but I have also been using on my forehead and by my smile lines.<br /><br />***The instruction manual is pretty clear and straightforward. You definitely need to read this before getting started. Here is some information that you can find within the manual:<br /><br />-They say all skin tones and anyone over the age of 12 can use NIRA to reduce the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes<br />-You need to clean and dry your face just prior to using NIRA<br />-It can be using morning or night and up to twice daily. They recommend waiting 1 minute before retreating each area and not to treat more than twice within a 1-hour period.<br />-Do not treat the same spot twice in a row, even if the pulse is rejected and you get the low pitched, negative sounding beep<br />-The instructions clearly show you the recommended way to treat the undereye area and the treatment pattern to use<br />-They recommend using the highest power level where you feel warmth without pain<br />-You should use a facial moisturizer after each treatment and a daily sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is recommended. This bundle includes the hyaluronic acid serum which can also be used.<br />-Device should be kept clean and free of dust, especially the glass lens which can be cleaned with a cotton swab. Surfaces can be cleaned with 70% alcohol solution between each use.<br />-They say some potential side effects include: skin warmth, redness, and stinging. Less frequent side effects include dryness, roughness, tanned appearance to skin, swelling, flaking, itching, crusting, bruising, pimple-like rash, irritated skin, blistering, scarring, infection, and skin color changes where your skin may become darker or lighter. I have only experienced the temporary warmth and stinging during use- no redness or anything else.<br />-The company also cautions those who have skin conditions or are undergoing professional cosmetic treatments such as injectable toxins like Botox or fillers- saying to check with your doctor or clinician prior to using NIRA.<br />-Only use on intact skin<br />-Don’t use if pregnant or nursing or undergoing fertility treatments<br />-Do not use if you have a history of skin cancer, any other cancer, or pre-malignant moles<br />-Do not treat if you have tanned skin which is apparently at increased risk of adverse effects with light-based devices<br /><br />Overall, I’m happy with how the product functions and the ease of use. I will continue using and will update if I have any further comments or concerns. I haven’t noticed any real results yet, but I also haven’t been using it that long. One question that comes to mind is this: What is the lifespan of this device? Months? Years? Or does it give out after firing the laser a certain number of times? I could have missed it in the manual, but that is something I’m still not sure of. For the current price of $329, that is something I think people may want to know. I haven’t had any issues with the serum that comes in this package, but it seems pretty simple and basic.",B08P2DZB4X,1639396471514,4.0
AEZG2W4TRMMNFFAWS2BPQE676K4Q,"No Fragrance, Moisturizing, Not The Greatest Value-Improvements Could Be Made","These Doctor Babor Hyaluronic Acid Serum Power Serum Ampoules seem pretty good. I definitely like this better than their collagen concentrate ampoules, but there are things that could have been changed to make me like this product a lot more.<br /><br />-Received 7 glass ampoules with 2ml of product inside each one<br />-Well presented in a nice looking silver display box<br />-You have to snap the glass ampoules open. They do provide a plastic cylindrical piece to aid in doing so. I’m a nurse, so I’m used to breaking open these kinds of ampoules without any issue. I can imagine that some people would not like this though<br />-Watery serum that glides across skin easily<br />-Honestly, a little seems to cover a large area of skin. 2ml may not seem like a lot, but a single ampoule seems like way more than would be needed for one application. I have split one into 3-4 uses to be honest<br />-I’m assuming the company intends for one whole ampoule to be used as one application because each one is labeled as day 1-7, and they provide no way to seal an ampoule back after using which I found to be rather frustrating<br />-Absorbs rapidly and doesn’t feel sticky or tacky after drying like the collagen concentrate did<br />-Their collagen concentrate ampoules also had a heavy fragrance, so I was SO relieved to find that there is no added fragrance with these<br />-Made in Germany<br /><br />So does it really help with plumping, smoothing, and reducing wrinkles? I don’t know. I definitely like the way my skin looks and feels right after application, but I haven’t noticed anything drastic.<br />As I previously stated, the 2ml of serum feels like A LOT to me if you try to put it all on your face at once. Unfortunately, this company also does not provide a way to seal an individual ampoule back for future use since they apparently intend for one ampoule to be an entire application. I remember I tried a set by the ISDIN brand with glass ampoules just like these. In the kit, the company included a top to slide over the opened glass ampoule with a cap to seal for future use. This was awesome and so convenient. I was disappointed to find out that this company did not include anything like that (I took a picture of that top and cap on one of these ampoules so you can see).<br /><br />Anyway, it is possible that this product may provide good results when used long term, but I just don’t really like this being intended for use over 7 days only. If they included a top with cap to seal each individual ampoule so that the product could be used over a longer period of time, I would like it much more. I would definitely prefer a serum in a larger bottle with dropper lid.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know – thanks! I’ll be sure to update if I have any other comments to add.",B08VQY1Z1S,1625107342095,4.0
AEZG2W4TRMMNFFAWS2BPQE676K4Q,Nice Little Open Storage- Not What I Would Choose For Traveling,"This CONBOLA Make Up Organizer is pretty handy for organizing small makeup items. I ordered the white and grey, and it looks quite nice. I would say it looks just like the pictures.<br /><br />The grey is a sturdy and durable plastic. The white inserts are a nice, thick, and flexible silicone. It will separate into 7 different pieces which is convenient and also makes everything easy to clean. You can use it all together or individual pieces separately.<br /><br />The mirror is fine and you insert into place and remove by pulling back out. I do think they missed an opportunity to have this on a detachable hinge or something.<br /><br />I think my favorite part of this product is the silicone insert that you can insert various makeup pencils, brushes, etc in standing up. Most of my brushes don’t fit as well into the bigger sized slots, but it still works.<br /><br />This is cute overall, but I think the biggest improvement that could be made to this other than a hinged mirror would be to make this deeper. As you can see in my picture, there is a standard sized setting powder sitting in the main compartment. It fits there, but not if you wanted to put the mirror/lid down to cover it.<br /><br />Basically this is a cute open storage. Most off the products I have pictured would not fit in this for any type of closed storage. I think the company could make this design into and awesome display/storage case that fully closes with a handle for traveling or something- but it would have to be much deeper.<br /><br />I don’t think this is something I would want to take traveling, because I would have to take everything out and put in a bag or something before also packing this up and that defeats the purpose of it for traveling in my opinion. Some people may like to have this to display and openly store all their items when traveling though, but it just wouldn’t be my first choice since you can’t pack everything inside it when it is time to go.<br /><br />Anyway, this is still a nice little product if you think the size and function will suit your needs.

AEZG2W4TRMMNFFAWS2BPQE676K4Q,Interesting Gritty Texture And Strong Clove Scent,"This Spa-Da Immunity Support Soap is one of the more interesting soaps I have tried. You get a pack of 6 small shield shaped soaps in a resealable plastic bag. The soaps are about 2.75 inches in length.<br /><br />The scent is strong when you open the bag and especially in the shower. Some of the oils and ingredients included are cloves, cinnamon, oregano, peppermint, parsley, eucalyptus, and rosemary. If you don’t like the smell of cloves, then do not order this because that is the most predominant smell in my opinion. I like it though- it has a nice spicy kick.<br /><br />The soap definitely feels different than I expected. It doesn’t feel really smooth like many soaps. When dry, they were slightly powdery when I ran my finger across. They are slightly gritty feeling which I noticed more once the soap became wet in the shower. This could be nice if you like a slight scrubby feeling. I typically rub it onto my mesh bath sponge or silicone sponge so I don’t really care about the grittiness either way. I found that it lathers and suds up very well with both my mesh and silicone sponges.<br /><br />I just started using, so I’m not sure how many showers I’ll be able to get out of each bar. Honestly, I thought they might disintegrate and get used up fast simply based on how powdery they felt when dry. I don’t think it will last as long as some other soaps, but I was still surprised that I could somewhat see the outline of where the shallow cross was imprinted on the soap even after my first shower-and I did intentionally scrub my sponges all over that side pretty vigorously. I took a picture of what the soap looked like after one shower compared to unused bars.<br /><br />Anyway, my skin feels very clean, perhaps even a little moisturized after using and I haven’t experienced any irritation to my sensitive skin (I have eczema).<br /><br />I like that this soap is natural and free from harmful chemicals. I also love that it is made in the USA-Ohio specifically, which is where I am from.<br /><br />I’ll be sure to update my review if any issues arise like if I find that the bars do in fact get used far too quickly. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!!!",B086TS3BKQ,1611627119713,5.0

There is no bad taste at all, though I couldn’t particularly taste a flavor. I think it is a great formula- no complaints.<br /><br />The chap sticks are standard size with the usual twist up and cap. They are a little pricey, but you are getting what seems to be a high quality product. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know-thanks!",B08G5YVHQP,1607587453973,5.0

AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,"Fantastic, amply powered nano mist sprayer/spritzer. Not just water.","At first, the significant other wondered why this was larger than other nano mist sprayers that we own. Then I explained that those other sprayers restrict the liquid to water, and some require distilled water. This fine mist sprayer is described as being akin to an airbrush. ""Works with serum, water-soluble toner, lotion, milk or mineral water for care spa. Not only the skin on the face, it also can be used for the maintenance of body and hair, anti-static and moisturizing."" That perked up her ears, and she said, ""Wow, yeah?""<br />She took the product, after the review photos, and charged the internal battery. A fully charged battery can provide up to an hour of continuous use. Not too shabby.<br />Her report was all favorable. She was amazed at the power, it was noticeably stronger than any of the other nano mist sprayers. We weren't fully sure about the oxygen/hyperbaric process, but she felt the misting was much more effective and efficient.<br />I asked if the size bothered her. She said, no. it's a worthwhile tradeoff, the power and efficacy (as measured by only one application) outweighs the increase in size. Further, she said that this is how mist sprayers should be. You should be able to put any liquid inside the reservoirs, and get a nano/fine misting. Almost all the nano sprayers just allow water. This product doesn't just 'wet' your face, it allows an actual treatment. And that's what is important.<br />And, in terms of size and portability, she said it's well within reason to carry around. But, for the most part, she thinks most will keep/use this at home. And, take it along with other sundry cosmetics when traveling or for special purposes.<br />So, the verdict is that this is a significant upgrade for the product genre. It delivers on the statements in the product details, matching the pictures and description in the product details.  I feel it meets, perhaps surpasses, her expectations of a nano mist sprayer. Based on these initial impressions and performance, this product earns a 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",B09671G4KH,1627259240050,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Attractive. Excellent construction. Smooth rolling action.,"This facial massage roller is exactly as shown in the product details. The roller is composed of quality materials and manufacture. While they give instructions for cooling therapy, by placing it in the fridge, it can also be used for warming application. I use a heating pad or heated gel pack to envelop the massage tool (specifically the rollers). This warms the metal roller sufficiently to afford a warming massage.<br />The one minor issue is the brand name emblazoned on the handle. I would have preferred a solid purple coloring on the handle. This is shown in the pictures in the product details, so this issue won't affect the rating. However, I do feel it's too large, conspicuous on the handle.<br />The significant other still uses this with the rollers at ambient temperature or cooled. However, she does like it when I warm the rollers and apply a massage to the back and sides of the neck.<br />Overall, this metal facial massage roller is exactly as shown and described in the product details. It's well made, durable and attractive. It meets expectations, earning a 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",B08RYN11N9,1624888732014,5.0

AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,"Nice facial steaming product, with handy portable misting device.  Decent performance.","At a spa, people go into the steamroom to relax muscles, open pores and detoxify. This device isn't a steamroom but aims at providing some of the same benefits to the face and neck, especially regarding the skin and pores. This device heats water up to 104F, creating steam which is expelled from the golden rim outlet. Unfortunately it cannot handle the addition of essential oils,  recommending only pure water (or weak alkaline mineral water). This would have been a fantastic ability and function. Oh well. As a pure water streaming device, it is a decent performer.<br />It does not take long for the water to heat, about 30 seconds, and a fine steam mist is pushed out from the device. The optimum range is 6 - 10 inches away from the steam port. It's a good idea to start at a 12 inch distance, and ease your face closer, gauging your skins tolerance.<br />(Note: you can add toner that can fully dissolve into the water. The key is not to have a viscous liquid, or particulates, which will adversely affect the atomization.)<br />We found operation to be fairly simple and easy. Fill the water reservoir, put reservoir back into it's position. turn on the unit, within 30 seconds face gets a spa steam experience.<br />Is this as effective as those face steamers that have a cone that keeps the steam contained? No, because the steam floats freely. But, it's also multiples cheaper than those kinds of facial steaming devices. This is a credible portable device, that is compact enough that it won't take up much counter space. It's minimalist design will allow it to fit in with most decor.<br />It's easy to set up and operate. It's acceptably effective.<br />Also included with this steaming device is a mini misting device,  a headband (with pink ears) and 4 skin care tools (intended to help treat acne and blackheads).<br />The mini misting device does not heat the water you put in it. Rather, via a rechargeable battery, a touch of the button will spray a fine mist. This is very handy in the summer, when you might want a spritz of water to help cool you when outside. It's an apt complement to the facial steaming device.<br />I found the facial steaming device to be capable of decent performance. If you have realistic expectations, you'll enjoy this product. And, I like the rechargeable portable misting device.<br />Overall, a worthwhile product set, which earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",B08P4YQ3K5,1614396527233,5.0

AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Excellent quality. Very attractive assortment of confetti and glitter polishes. Small bottles.,"This is an excellent assortment of attractive, quality gel polish, with base coat and top coat (no wipe and matte versions). The presentation elevates the worth as a gifting option.  One of the best features of this set is the bottles of gel polish provide actual representations of the contents. On the top of the cap is a sticker with proper identification of the color (including glitter, confetti varieties). Also on the front label is a small circle, under the brand name, that has an accurate portrayal of the contents. Finally, a company gets it. So, this boosts the rating a bit.<br />There are 16 varieties of gel polish, with confetti and glitter. The consistency is perfect, allowing application of a thin coat. An ability to apply a thin coat is essential, mainly due to the size of these bottles. They are 5ml (0.17fl oz), which is one of the smallest bottles of gel polish that i've encountered. This is actually a disappointing size/quantity of gel polish. Based on the size of the bottles of gel polish, I consider this to actually be a sampler set, as opposed to a set of 'normal' sized bottles of attractive confetti, glitter gel polishes. So, i guess one can try out the various polishes and then purchase larger bottles of desired varieties.<br />Overall, I feel all of the polishes in the assortment are visually attractive. The polishes are excellent quality, and produce excellent results. The significant other tested the gel on some fake nails, and i commented that it looks beautiful as is...no need to add any embellishments/decorations. She agreed., but said she'd combinde solid color gel polish with these, and add some rhinestones or other decorations, maybe create a marbled effect. I could see her creative juices flowing.<br />The product does match the descriptions and pictures in the product details. The presentation is effective and top notch. We like the quality and consistency of the gel polishes and base/top coats.  If the bottles were at least the size of the base/top coat bottles, this set would be perfect and worth 5 stars. As currently configured, based on observations and impressions, this quality 'sampler' set earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",B08GKVYS1Y,1614054869460,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Excellent gel polish. 6 glorious colors.,"A smart presentation elevates this as a gifting option. You receive 6  bottles, 8ml (0.26fl oz), of popular fall, winter colors.  The significant other loved 5 of them, and thought the brown was nice, but doesn't complement her. But, that is would work nicely if she used contrasting decorations on it. So, actually all 6 are attractive and usable, but she was especially fond of the other 5. haha.<br />Attached are photos to show the unboxing, and images of the product. Also a close-up of the gel polish that was being used today.<br />The gel polish is rich and somewhat thick. The significant other said it's really good. That she can use a thin layer and get good coverage. The bottles are numbered, but wouldn't it be smart to put a dot with the actual color of the enclosed gel polish on the bottle top? She agreed, and shrugged her shoulders. Since this seems like an industry standard, of not identifying the colors with...color, the lack thereof does not ding the rating.<br />These seem to be quality gel polishes. The colors are rich and look great after UV curing. Personally, I don't comprehend 'fall, winter' colors, but I appreciate the vibrant color.<br />Based on initial impressions, this set receives a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",B08P15TB2V,1613951680692,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Very nice design/form. Easy base top connection. Provides USB ports.,"This is a surprising UV curing lamp. It has a minor elaboration of the conventional design, allowing for a slightly wider opening, but still having a multi=angle lamp placement. 72 Watts is not the most powerful UV rating for this gel curing/drying lamp, but is more than ample power to do the job in reasonably quick time.<br />That said, I believe that this UV lamp actually normally will output 36W, unless you specifically activate the ""Double Power"" setting. To do this, you select one of the 3 'regular' timers: 10S, 30S or 60S (S = seconds). This sets the timing for the lamp operation. If you then press the last button, which is also the 99S ""Lowe Heat Mode"" button, and hold for about 3 seconds, it will activate the lamp into 72W...double the power. Thus the regular default UV setting is 36W.  If you press the 99S button, the UV power will gradually increase over the 99 seconds.<br />The device also has a sensor to turn the system on/off depending if it senses hand/foot in the cavity. If you need more time, just hit one of the timer buttons again.<br />There is no power on/off button. Once you plug the power adapter in, the unit is 'on' and ready to go, once you set timer and insert your fingers.<br />While the opening is wider than most other UV lamps, it's still a tight fit for both hands. But, I appreciate the slight elaboration of the cavity opening.<br />One new design element that I truly appreciate is the method to connect the top and base. There are small posts with magnets atop them. These magnetically attach to corresponding screws in recessed holes. So, it takes minimal effort to separate them, but easily hold together. Other lamps have a tab in slot method that sometimes is difficult to unlock or match up easily to attach. This improvement is a smart innovative upgrade.<br />Another innovation is the inclusion of USB-A and USB-C ports, located about the power plug port. Both of these USB ports are rated at only 5V 2A. So check the usb specs of any device you connect to these USB charging ports. But, it's a nice addition, anyway. It is a handy port to connect a nail dust fan, or nail drill.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with close-ups to highlight features.<br />On my wish list is a separate power on/off button, and while the display is view-oriented for the person inserting fingers, it would make sense to have the timer buttons oriented in the same manner. I think most people purchasing these lamps are DIY nail artists. It's not too difficult to manage the timer buttons, but it would just be simpler and common sense to have these controls positioned for easy operation by the user. These issues apply to all the UV lamps that I've encountered. It's a personal perspective/opinion, and does not affect the ratings of this device.<br />So, this UV curing lamp is default 36W, with the capability of user option to double power to 72W. It has a nice design and improved magnetic connection for top and base.  it's a very capable and competent device.<br />Accordingly, it earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",B08MT8L5ZL,1613265469654,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,"Amazingly soft brush. Premium quality, nice design.","This long handle brush is exactly as described and depicted in the product details. The handle is bamboo, and appears very durable. The brush is amazingly soft, the texture actually surprised me. The bottom of the handle has a rope loop, to hang up after use (you can also put the loop around the wrist while using it). A nice touch, rope is wound around the lower end of the handle for a more secure grip. This is useful when in the bath or shower, and water could make any handle slippery.<br />The only thing I'd change would be for a bit larger brush head. The diameter is approximately 3 inches. It's fine, but a larger brush head would be better.<br />The brush does lather up nicely, and feels nice against the skin. Time and use will determine the durability of the brush head. However, from initial impression it seems to be quality materials.<br />This brush easily met my expectations. It earns a solid 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",B08N9RT9YD,1611190792732,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Perfect size. Excellent silicone squeeze bottle with mini-carabiner.,"This set of 6 soft squeeze silicone bottles, with mini-carabiner (ok, they're not actually carabiners; they're belt clips, but similar to being small carabiners, allowing you to secure the bottle to backpacks, belt loops, etc). The bottles come with 3 in clear, 1 blue, 1 green and 1 pink. It's a good mix, and the clear probably being the most versatile, since you'll be able to view the quantity and more easily identify the contents.<br />The silicone appears to be very good quality, is soft enough to easily squeeze, but firm enough to retain it's shape. Plus the tactile qualities of the silicone is very nice. The screw cap has a hinged topper that has a plug that fits snugly into the spout. The cap screws onto a hard plastic threaded piece. It's a relatively simple design that just works well.<br />Using plain water as a test, there was not a single drop of leakage. A very good sign. I did not abuse the bottle, and I'm sure that with enough pressure on the silicone bottle the cap could open, or there could be a leak. But, under normal circumstances I don't see leaks happening.<br />These are ideal to keep handy good quantities of hand sanitizer, hand lotion, creams, essential oils. I like the idea of the belt clip and the general design of the bottle.<br />Examination of the bottles found uniform construction, with no defects or flaws. These are cute and functional.<br />These silicone squeeze bottles earn a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",B08HRHCZV2,1610165574675,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,"Very good set for a beginner. Excellent color selection, with base and top coat bottles.","The manner of presentation raises it's value as a gifting option. This is a fairly good assortment of color poly gel polishes, including 2 tubes of temperature changing polishes (an addition not usually found in beginner sets). Small jars of base coat and top coat (10ml each) complete the liquid components of this set.  2 nail art tools are included: a two sided positioning pen and nail file board (the rather large pink item in the attached photos).<br />The gel poly polishes come in 15ml (0.5fl oz) tubes. The colors cover the range of popular hues. The gel poly tends to be on the thicker side. For a beginner to intermediate user, perhaps the best approach is to use slip solution or alcohol. Put a small quantity of alcohol or slip solution into a small bowl/container. Apply some gel polish then dip your brush into the alcohol, and smooth out the polish. The alcohol or slip solution acts as a solvent to loosen up the polish, enabling the user to manipulate the polish more easily. It's better to deal with a gel polish that is too thick, than a circumstance of the polish being too loose/thin. Also, gel poly is a different product than regular liquid nail polish.<br />Overall, a very good set for beginners. Intermediate users will find use for the colors, especially the temperature based color changing varieties. And top coat and base coat bottles are always handy to have as additional resources.<br />Based on these considerations, this set obtains a solid 4 star rating.",B088TXBCB5,1610077020628,4.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Great amber glass spray bottles. Exactly as described and shown.,"These are excellent amber colored glass spray bottles. The capacity of each bottle is 16 ounces. Keep in mind that this is glass, not plastic. There are inherent advantages to using glass, such are durability and environmental concerns. Also, glass will not chemically interact with most liquids (however, caution is still necessary since the spray top and mechanism is composed of plastic). The disadvantage is that this kind of glass bottle is heavier than comparative plastic bottles. The amber color protects the contents from light (sunlight and uv exposure). My view is this type of spray bottle is more on the premium end of the scale.<br />Included accessories: 4 regular screw on tops, 1 screw on eye dropper top, funnel, labels and marker. Each of the bottles comes with the plastic spray top already installed. I appreciate the regular tops, which effect a better seal than the spray tops, which will protect the contents from spills, evaporation and contaminants. I wish they provided at least 2 of the eye dropper tops, but I guess even getting one, when the the product is sold as spray bottles, is a bonus.<br />The sprayer mechanism can actually rotate, it's not a one piece sprayer top, the screw on segment is separate from the spraying segment. This is not a cheap spraying cap.<br />The set of 4 amber color glass bottles fully matches the descriptions and pictures in the product details. At $34, these are a bit pricey, but the glass is substantial, not thin.<br />Overall, these are impressive, and appear to be a premium variation of spray bottle. And priced accordingly.<br />These spray bottles receive a solid 4.5 star rating.",B08HGZXLP6,1610068366632,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Small bottles (.25 oz) of beautiful metallic glittery gel polish.,"This would make a great addition to an existing manicure/nail art set. Included in this set are 6 bottles of quality gel polish, 7.5ml (0.25 ounces). While each bottle could do a few maniures, I think of them as being more akin to samplers. For the price, I would have like more quantity.<br />It's winter, in fact we're having a severe snow storm right now. So, perhaps the cold affected the polish. Per the companies suggestion, we immersed a bottle in warm/hot water (not too hot). This had the effect of loosening the consistency of the gel polish. Whew!<br />The polish, with metallic glitter, is like metallic paint on a car, only more shiny and glittery. My original intent was to use this on 3D printed models, or for my crafts. But, the significant other made a convincing argument that it's gel NAIL polish. So, she claimed it (after I restored it via the hot water bath), and took it to her nail art/crafts station. She mentioned that it didn't have the strong 'stink' that some other glitter gel polishes have. Okay...She said that if she does her nails, she can't help me shovel the snow tomorrow. Why didn't I think of doing my nails, first?<br />The price of this set is slightly higher than comparable products (a dollar or two). I can't compare the products, but the quality of this set is very good. Plus, the fact that it needed a hot water bath, I feel the thickness is a positive indication of the quality of the polish. Being thicker means needing less for good coverage.<br />Overall, positive impresseions regarding this gel polish. It garners a solid 4 star rating, with a moderately high level recommendation.",B08CVCLVS2,1608163838948,4.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,"Beautiful, precision tweezers. Nice case, with cleaning brush.","This set actually exceeded my expectations based on the pictures in the product details. It easily matches up to the descriptions and depictions in the product details. It is attractive enough, that this would be welcomed as a gift.<br />Inspection of the implements found no defects or flaws, there were no scratches or marks on the nice black surface. The lengths might be a bit on the smaller size, but they are easily manipulated with one hand.<br />The only issue I have is there is no specific slot in the case for the scissors. So, it either rests between slots or shares it with one of the tweezers.<br />Overall, these are excellent tweezers and petite scissors. It merits a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",B08C2T24WG,1607893968551,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,Exciting assortment of gels. Excellence!!!,"Excellent assortment of poly gels that will complement anyone's collection. These are nice sized tubes, with popular colors and some pearlescents. This would make a welcome addition to the home nail artist, or to simply add beautiful poly gel polish to the nails. I note that this would make a good addition or complement a collection, because you'll need a UV lamp to cure the poly gel. And a brush is necessary, too.<br />Included in this set are some generic fake nails and some gold foil nail forms to facilitate nail artistry. Also, they include a container of silvery glitter as a free gift. Nice touch.<br />This is a very nice set, and the overall quality (including the presentation) makes this a serious gifting option.<br />Overall, this set earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating with a high level recommendation.",B08DHZW3LK,1603299307441,5.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,"Light pink hue, good quality. Bit pricey for one tube 15g.","This poly gel is a light shade of pink. In the product details, the picture what shows a finger/fingernail, the pink is a bit lighter than the tip of that nail. Also, depending on how thin/thick you make the nail will affect the translucent aspect, making it appear lighter or darker.<br />The product seems to be good quality, time will tell how long the nail actually lasts.<br />The main issue is this seems to be somewhat expensive compared to other brands (some of which are well established). There are sets with 4 - 6 tubes, with different shades/colors, at 3 - 4 times the cost of this one tube. (for the mathematically challenged, that makes this tube around 50 - 75% more expensive per tube.)<br />So, it's a good quality product, but the cost ratio affects the recommendation. Thus, it's a 3 - 3.75 star product with a moderate level recommendation.",B085QDWHQJ,1598647049457,4.0
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,"Nice, silicone back 'brush' bit too soft. Good handles.","We gave this 3 test uses for an initial assessment of this back scrubber/brush. It is designed nicely, with handles that make usage very user friendly. If they made this out of elastic, you could shower and do resistance band exercises. hehe. Seriously, the handles work well, and act as convenient loops to hang the device to dry out in the shower.<br />There is an issue with using silicone brush heads, they tend to be soft/flexible. So, if you use this brush, do not expect the same experience as a loofah or bristle brush. And, you have to really work up a lather in your hands and then transfer it to the silicone brush head. Attempts to create foam/lather by rubbing body wash or soap on the silicone just wasn't satisfactory.<br />As mentioned, the brush surface tends to be soft/gentle. The 'scrubbing' side does rub, but nowhere near deep cleaning or exfoliating level. The bumpy side, for massage, does provide a textured rub, but is even less effective for soaping and cleaning your back.<br />Maybe I'm too old school, liking my cleaning brush to be able to really scrub.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br />Did not use the included hooks, because we used the shower caddy that already had hooks for shower accessories. The bonus bath sponge looks fine, but did not use that yet. Again, maybe I don't pamper myself enough while showering. haha. If the significant other uses it, any pertinent information will be added to this review. However, I think the majority of people will be concerned about the effectiveness and quality of the back scrubber.<br />So, the product does match the description and depiction in the product details. However, my opinion is the softness of the brush hinders the effectiveness as a shower back scrubbing device. I do like that it is very resistant to mold and is extremely easy to clean and maintain. Maybe I have to learn to adapt to the softer texture of this type of brush. Based on our experience, this silicone brush garners a 3.5 rating. If you already use and like silicone back scrubbers, this is a quality product worth considering. If you are old school, this might disappoint expectations.",B08FD2KP9R,1598564297736,3.0

AHOYQ263ZGBZIBPQGKNVAWG35DNQ,LOVE This Burt's Bees Package!,"I Love Burt's Bees products. I'm not sharing them generously with anyone - they're all for me, me, me.<br /><br />First of all, I like that the products are designed for sensitive skin. Like most people, I have a mix of really delicate skin and skin on which I could get a tattoo and not notice. So I love that these products support my delicate skin areas.<br /><br />And I like that Burt's uses natural origin ingredients - and no synthetic fragrances. I feel like I type this in every review: like 1B (in 2021) people, 3:1 of which are women, I suffer from chronic migraines. And like 95% of those sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell, and for me, artificial fragrances are dreadful. (I've found artificially made ""Honey"" to be one of the worst.) Burt's Bees products consistently have mild, unobtrusive natural scents.<br /><br />That's not to say I like every single Burt's Bees product, but their baby skin care products leave my adult skin feeling baby soft. I especially like the apricot baby oil, which is extra softening, smells faintly of apricot and leaves my skin feeling wonderful.  And I'm so happy that they have the ingredients not just on the products, but listed on Amazon as well, so we know in advance what we're getting. Awesome. Yes, I'm the baby here, and happy to be one if that means I get to use these great products.",B08MC3ZLV4,1624744756668,5.0

AHOYQ263ZGBZIBPQGKNVAWG35DNQ,Love this Hydration!,"I really love this hydrating and moisturizing product.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I would at first. Although the box is in English, and has clear instructions and ingredients, the product itself lacks those things. Celimax comes in a streamlined bottle that looks like mineral water. Aside from the general disaster that could pose with small children, the FDA requires cosmetic products sold in the USA list their ingredients on the bottle in English.<br /><br />The ingredients, by the way, which I wish Amazon would leave a spot for cosmetic vendors to include in their listings, so we would know before we order in case of allergies, are Sedum Sarmentosum, Butylene Glycol, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide NP, Xylityglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Dipotassium Glycrrhizate, Citrus Tangerina Peel Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, Glucose, Phospholifpids, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Caprylic/Capric Triclyceride, Ammonium Acryloylidimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-13 Pareth-9, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin.<br /><br />Having said that, I poured a little bit of the product onto a cotton pad in the evening and dabbed it onto my face, and onto the back of my hands. It initially felt just  a bit tacky, but almost immediately absorbed. I followed up on my face with my nightly cream. My face this morning feels AMAZING. The moisture level is through the roof.<br /><br />I also want to mention fragrance. Like 95% of chronic migraine headache sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell. Anything cosmetic that has perfume (think lip smackers) or added scent has the potential to make me nauseous and bring on a migraine. This had just a faint authentic citrus smell, vaguely pleasant, which thankfully disappeared within a few seconds of hitting the cotton ball. That kind of fragrance is ideal.<br /><br />And the effects are just amazing. I don't see my face all day, but I can sure see my hands on the keyboard. My hands are visibly more plumper, less dry, and  more hydrated. I am loving this product.

They pull and push gently against your skin as you roll. It's an intersting sensation. These balls are also made out of metal and provides this cool sensation on your skin.<br /><br />I use the tool after the base of my skin care routine is applied. It helps my skin absorb without me having to pat on it numerous times. The face roller also helps sculpt your face but also get circulation flowing on your face without having to go visit a massage salon.,B08RYN11N9,1625800228958,5.0

It's a Garnier product.<br /><br />I have been searching for an item like this because I travel a lot and shampoo my hair daily. Unfortunately, I have a lot of hair and because I like lots of lather and shampoo my hair so often this bar is shrinking fast. They advertise it for two months but I just hope I can get a full month out of it. I love everything about the shampoo bar minus the longevity.",B0941YDPSW,1624995008671,4.0
AGXMWJK3YL4SV5FJ27JEJZPZHRBA,"Lightweight, High Absorption, Moisturizing Essence for Foundation of Skin Care Routine","The Celimax The Real Sedum Aqua Boosting Essence comes in a clear bottle of 150ml. It's a good size bottle that will probably will probably last me 9-10 months. The packaging is attractive and highly simple and modern. There's almost no scent to the essence, maybe a very faint scent of citrus if I were to pinpoint, which is ideal for people who have sensitive nose.<br /><br />I am not a chemist so the ingredients described have no meaning to me. Though, the essence contains hyaluronic acid which is the main ingredient in the toner that I use for final stage of my daily facial cleaning process. The toner is a lot thicker in content and leaves my skin sticky whereas this essence is very water based and feels amazing after applying. My skin reacted and absorbed the essence right away and left my skin smooth and moisturized without feeling any stickiness. Even my hands got moisturized and I do not have to wipe or wash away after the application. I learned through reading the product description that this essence contains low molecular weight hyaluronic acid, which with its small molecular structure makes it easier for it to absorb into the skin. This speaks true to the application because I use the essence right after I wash my face and this sets the base for my skincare routine and helps maxmize the absorbtion of other products.<br /><br />Without reading too much into it, this is a five-star product that is lightweight with almost no scent, keeps your skin moisturized and hydrated, and prepped for your daily skin care routine.",B084WP4XS8,1624307934053,5.0
AGXMWJK3YL4SV5FJ27JEJZPZHRBA,Good Face Mask for Moisturization,"The order of the face masks come packaged in a box. There are 24 face masks individually packaged. The mask comes with a clear plastic layer underneath that's folded up with the face mask. This allows for the face mask to be easily removed andn opened, because other products just have the face mask folded up by itself and it's always a struggle to unfold them.<br /><br />The face mask is a perfect fit for my face. There are plenty of face masks out there that are oversized or does not have the slits in the right place to fit the face form, but I could tell the fit would be perfect the moment I put them on.<br /><br />The face masks are soaked in hyaluronic acid and there was plenty left in the package after the face mask was removed, for me to squeeze additional gel onto my face. I left the face mask on for about 15 minutes. The area around my nose and cheeks still had plenty of moisture on it but the edges near the chin were dried up. The face mask seems to harden in the areas that are dried up.<br /><br />After the application, my skin did not absorb all the serum and it was still wet. I gently tapped around the area to get it evenly spread and dissolve. The skin felt moisturized. It wasn't sticky nor did it dry up my face. I am satisfied with the result and the product.",B08XZDXTG2,1620761176566,5.0

AGXMWJK3YL4SV5FJ27JEJZPZHRBA,Microfiber Towel to Cover Entire Length of My Long Hair,"I have long and thick hair and it's always a hassle to dry them. I have been purchasing different types of microfiber hair towels and I want to say this is one of the best out there. First of all, many claim that their product works for long hair but when I try them I usually get a good length of hair sticking out. The towel is never long enough to cover the length of my hair. However, I was so happy to find that this microfiber towel covered my entire hair. The towels are absorbent and keeps my hair drying nicely without the use of a hair dryer, which tends to create a lot of fizz. The only thing is that because the towel is longer and larger than usual, it tends to slip. I recommend wrapping the hair before tying on to the button to keep the towel tightly wrapped around your hair. Other than that, I have no complaints with the product.",B08Q3F3L7S,1615160405039,4.0

The shower cap material is good quality. It is thick and waterproof. The cute, floral design is a plus and there is a cute bow in the front. Inside there is a silicone band that will hold the cap in place so I don't have to worry about the cap falling off. I have worn the cap around the house just to keep hair out of the way and it doesn't hurt my head. It has been super useful keeping my hair dry and style intact.",B09GNXK3N1,1615158696650,5.0

They are silicone tubes with white plastic caps. It comes with black key chain holder so it’s portable. Each tube holds 60 ML. I put high alcohol content hand sanitizer so it’s more liquid than gel. Unfortunately I have to be extra careful for the liquid to not spill out when using. Otherwise the tubes should be able to contain the get and you’d just squeeze the tube. The bottle itself is spill proof. The cap is sealed tight. It is easy to refill through the wide mouth opening to fill up with any content.",B08HRHCZV2,1606331965024,4.0
AGXMWJK3YL4SV5FJ27JEJZPZHRBA,Basic Color Gel Nails - no color indication,"The order comes with six different colored gel nail polish. The strange thing is, there are no colors labeled on the bottle. There’s a sticker for you to apply the gel and cure on sheet of white circle stickers to put on the bottle yourself. I found this strange and did not like it at all. The color swatches that I applied the gel polish to had the colors coming off of the sticker so I have to open the bottles to check the colors..<br /><br />There set comes with six different colors -<br />15 - black<br />16 - white<br />17 - dark purple<br />18 - dark brown/grey<br />19 - light beige<br />20 - red<br /><br />I like the basic colors. The gel quality I would say is average. Make sure you use the base and top coat that works because it makes a world difference. The first time I applied, the gel coating peeled off in a matter of few hours of application. I used a different brand of coating and they have so far lasted 1.5 weeks. I applied the gel nail polish just as I do every two weeks - dehydrate nails, base and top coat application with LED/UV lamp.",B0876VC4KM,1606083616947,4.0

If you are looking for a sturdy brush that provides relief while brushing your hair, look no further, this is it! It’s hard to find quality brush at stores. Usually the products they offer have brushes where the color coating ends up peeling off or the brush bristles are just not made with quality. This brush feels strong where not too much pressure or weight is required to detangle. The bristles on this brush are round and feels so good against your head. I have thick hair so I need something to get through the hair jungle and this brush does the job. The order also comes with a black comb which I gave to my dad to use as it will just get stuck in my long thick hair.",B08BY9P4HR,1598036424116,5.0

At first I thought the product was cheaply made because of how plasticky it felt but I love how lightweight the lamp is. It is convenient to carry to any room or house of preference. You honestly do not even need a tutorial or instruction because of how simple it is to use. Simply plug in the lamp and it will automatically motion detect your hand and foot to trigger the lamp to dry. The default timer is set for 120 seconds but there are four other settings you can change to - 10s, 30s, 60s, 99s. I always have trouble with nails because it never dries fast enough and I’m impatient and end up messing up my nails before it dries.

Be careful when you dab the water onto the cotton pad as it can pour out. Though the product is described as a no-rinse cleanser, I would recommed washing your face after using the cleansing water. I worked out after removing my make-up with the cleanser but the product got in my eyes and it irritated them like when soap gets in your eyes.

This doesn't seem to be just a one-time occurrence. I also purchased the  ""Higher Education MBA Night Renewing Serum with 0.5% retinol"". That one expires even sooner - on Sep 2020.<br /><br />I don't know what Amazon's policy is on expiration dates for skin care products. But, if I were purchasing this from a physical store, I wouldn't get something that expires in less than 3 months. I expect a product to be good for at least a year. Granted, expired doesn't automatically mean that a product is unusable. However, customers don't like getting old stock especially when a customer still has to pay full price for it. I didn't it but, if I were, I'd be annoyed enough to return the item.<br /><br />I also don't know if Higher Education regularly sends soon-to-expire items to Amazon or if they're just doing this to Vine purchases.

The quality also differs from one another, some are really well made, some are loosely fitted and not well attached. The headband is wrapped with silk black lining and topped with colorful knotted cloth of velvet and chiffon materials.  With regards to the fitting, The ones with a very narrow gap tends to be painful overtime, other just causes minor discomfort at the back of the ears. Color variations are cute though and can really give a pop of color to an outfit. Price point wise is very affordable and ideal for gifting.",B089QR2Y5B,1596907967617,3.0
AHT7TDFPRBZE3GH7RFKCPSCEAR5Q,Not for me,"Love the duality of this, it’s easy to use and it dries pretty quick. However, it doesn’t work as well for me.

AHT7TDFPRBZE3GH7RFKCPSCEAR5Q,Soft,"Lightweight, most likely due to the relatively thin nature, and soft feeling. The bangs are a little too long for me though, they practically covered my eyes. But other than that, it’s a pretty nice wig.",B083122WRC,1627434439751,4.0

AHT7TDFPRBZE3GH7RFKCPSCEAR5Q,Lovely color,I like how the matte of this (I got maple road) came out on me. I only put a single layer and the color came out great. The color became darker once a couple minutes passed. There is easy transference of this and you’ll definitely need a touch up after eating and drinking.

When I wrap my hair in the towel soaking wet, my hair is pretty dry after about ten minutes.<br /><br />They are plenty big enough for long hair. I have no problems twisting my hair up and buttoning it. The two buttons make it even easier to button.<br /><br />I washed them in cold water in the washing machine, and dried them on low.<br /><br />After using them, I hang them up, and they dry really fast.<br /><br />The set included five towels. light blue,  light purple, rose, pink and gray.<br /><br />I recommend",B08Q3F3L7S,1616589130283,5.0
AHCA3FF2KQI7SRT32XBZCNHFEHOQ,Gentle enough to use on kittens,These hair scalp massager's work wonderfully for my foster kittens baths. The bristles are very soft to use on them.

AHCA3FF2KQI7SRT32XBZCNHFEHOQ,Love this lotion,"LA LA LEAF- Guayaquil Hemp Lotion has really been helping my dry skin. It is not a thick lotion. I use it when I get out of the shower. It does not leave a greasy flim once it dries. It dries and absorbs quickly. It is very moisturizing.<br /><br />It is made out of all natural ingredients including rose flower water, white willow bark extract, and Aloe leaf juice.  It has no parabens or phthalates.<br /><br />My only complaint is even though it is supposed to be unscented, the smell is quite strong. It doesn't linger long though once it dries.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this lotion.",B08BB3P4VQ,1602895527804,4.0

AHCA3FF2KQI7SRT32XBZCNHFEHOQ,Fits children better,"These headbands are not really that big. I had mine more like a tiara or it hurt behind my ears since it was tight. I love all the different colors.

I don't wear makeup often, but these work great for taking waterproof eyeliner off. I just soaked the pad in hot water and then wiped my eyes and the eyeliner came right off.<br /><br />They are made of microfiber material and are super soft. They are not very thick, but they do a fantastic job. The set comes with 18. 6 pink, 6 white, and 6 blue.<br /><br />Once your done using them, you can use the laundry bag provided and toss them in the washing machine or hand wash them.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these makeup pads.",B087F14JSH,1597303099124,5.0
AE3335XF4PMHSXKTW5B7N7EALG3Q,Not a very good mask...,"In terms of scent and quality, it is a clay mask, and it smells nice (like honey). Its application is easy, the clay spreads into a thin layer, BUT this mask is not for everyone. I am part of that ""not-everyone"". I have oily combo skin and somewhat sensitive skin...this mask upon application stung/burned. So the ingredients may not also be for everyone. But lets talk about the packaging and the quantity of the mask it self. The tin came all scratched up and ""worn out"". When I examined it, it looked as if it's old, and sat around for a while. (not a giftable appearance). Quantity and price is a joke. If you refer to my pictures, the small jar is about 30% full. Where is the other 70%? Or at least another 30%? This mask goes on your face in an even but thicker layer as all clay-masks do. So there is definitely no value here.",B07PCGSFGQ,1607796483793,2.0
AE3335XF4PMHSXKTW5B7N7EALG3Q,Has shimmer in the oil...,"Oil comes in a very elegant small glass bottle with dropper, but be aware that the glow that you achieve with this oil is due to the shimmer that is inside the bottle. This shimmer/glitter was very difficult to remove from pores and oilier areas on face like t-zone. Not something I recommend to apply on your face before bed-time.",B07NPCT6L5,1607583257366,3.0
AE3335XF4PMHSXKTW5B7N7EALG3Q,Cakey but nice coverage...,"The BB cream works just as well as a foundation. Really concentrated and thick/creamy, and you can definitely feel the sunscreen in it, cuz it makes it more thicker than most other BB creams with low levels of SPF. The color selection is SUPER limited, but I chose the lightest one and I am normally like a 120 Ivory in Maybelline (Matte version) drugstore foundation. It blended out very well. You need only but a small amount of it so it lasts a long time, and it has a pleasant smell to it (at least for me). The only and only thing I dislike is the cakiness of this foundation that forms in creases (around the mouth, eyes, forehead, chin area etc.). Primer no primer, lotion or no/lotion, setting spray or no setting spray - or just on bare cleansed face. Cakiness still forms for me in about 30-60 minutes. This happens even with super little application - which is annoying. But the quality of coverage and texture is there if it wasn't for the cakiness I experience every time I use it.",B08DXCVRNY,1606288126194,4.0
AE3335XF4PMHSXKTW5B7N7EALG3Q,Very luxurious foaming wash and scent...,"I don't typically like musk as its very strong and powdery.. But this body wash altered my perspective a bit. One small pump of this body wash covers your entire body. Is that not cost effective or what? The consistency of the soap it self is very dense and thick and not droopy and watery like most body washes out-there. The smell lingers for a few hours until you bathe again so its like wearing a perfume without a perfume (if you like the scent of course). The foam is also very rich if using this soap with a sponge. Sadly, everything about this product on the label (beside the name) is in Korean. But would totally recommend and acquire again in the future.",B08YJV9YL2,1603690611815,5.0
AE3335XF4PMHSXKTW5B7N7EALG3Q,Pretty and lots of fibers but smells funky,"The mascara is packaged in a very pretty box and tube. Very unusual and I haven't seen mascaras like this one before which makes it very visually appealing. The wand is silicone or rubbery. The mascara is very black and bold on the lashes (I have brown lashes and it pops in color). The fibers are there, there are very many of them and wand builds on those fibers very very well with every application stroke. There are two things that make me uncomfortable about this mascara. First is the smell of it. It is a very strong / pungent chemical smell that does not smell like your average mascara from a drug or department store. Second, it is made in China. Maybe I am paranoid, but learning a little of how cheap cosmetics are made oversees, the smell reminds me of all the descriptions from those documentaries. On the bright side (aside the smell), my eyes did not sting upon application, the mascara did not shed, and removing it (although it is waterproof) was very easy with regular miscellar water and a cotton pad. Because of the smell, not a product I would purchase again or give as a gift. But overall very pretty and definitely builds the length + volume with the fibers that are part of the mascara.",B086ST4W1C,1596091939884,4.0
AFRUBJ22O26J35OD5MJLBC6RUJKQ,I ordered three packs to cover the whole head,"I have been taking this hair extension for some time and installed it on my hair. They were almost easy to install. One thing about this extension is that I ordered three packs to cover the whole head. The length of the extension is the same as what is said on the site, but its width is a little less and not as wide as shown in the image. The weight of this extension is not low, but it is not so high that it can not be tolerated. Due to the fact that the hair is braided, it is expected to weigh a little more. I am also very happy with the hair color because they are well spread and create a uniform gradient.<br />It should only be noted that this extension has a high potential for fluff.",B08DKFV9SR,1632881610467,4.0

After a bit of searching on Amazon, I found this amber hair that was very beautiful in the picture. When I received the product, it did not look and feel good. But it was easy to install and use. I think the quality of the product is a little different from what the picture shows. But in terms of shine, the hair is of good quality. I have always wanted my hair to fall on my shoulders, and this hair is exactly what I was looking for.<br />If I want to summarize:<br />- Improper packaging<br />+ Good hair length<br />+ Easy installation",B085MCMZLX,1631588551142,3.0
AFRUBJ22O26J35OD5MJLBC6RUJKQ,lower than expected,"This UV lamp can be described in three aspects. Price, power and quality. I used it three times so far for different gels like Poly gel, gel polish and builder gel and it worked for all of them. Compare to other same product the price is so reasonable for a couple of reasons. First, the power is so high because I used to keep my fingers under UV for 2 minuets with other LED lams but this one just needs 90 seconds. The longer you keep your fingers under UV the more your skin get darker and also is not good for your health. The main purpose that I got this UV lamp was my pregnancy which I really did not want to go to the salons because I think the smell of so many chemicals in the salons is not good for my baby health. The quality of the lamp is not so good. Once it fell off on the carpet and it became a little bit loos however it is still working.<br />To put everything in a nutshell it is a good purchase if you are not a nail artist and you do not want to use it in your profession.<br />Pros:<br />1. High power<br />2. Good price<br />Cons:<br />1. Low body quality",B085ZRVDKP,1624821934670,3.0
AFRUBJ22O26J35OD5MJLBC6RUJKQ,best nail art kits that I have ever had,"I always feel regret with my nail because it does not have a good shape. In group of girls that I am, it is only I that have this problem. Therefore, I always have to spend a long time to shape my nail and polish it and so on. However, this process needs a considerable amount of money due to need for purchasing deferent tools and materials. Recently after doing some research, I found that I can buy DIY nail product. At first, I was suspicious that I may not be successful, but it worked. I am happy with this product that I received.<br />if I wanted to buy every single part separately, I had to pay so much money on this one worth pay. It also has rubbing alcohol inside, which makes my life easier it’s quality is really good; even the UV lamp is so strong, and a time duration that I have to keep my finger under the UV is so less camp compared to other UV‘s.

AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,I love the Tirtyl soap,"I’ve got the Tirtyl foaming hand soap at home that I love and I thought I would give this a try. From the foaming hand soap I have the coconut and vanilla, and the lavender and aloe. I thought the lavender and aloe sheets would smell the same as the foaming soap but it does not. Far from it. The sheets smell far too musky, strong, and more like men’s cologne on my hands. Not a fan of that one, but glad the smell doesn’t last long after the hand washing. The bergamot and Ylang ylang, and the jasmine and patchouli both smell nice but it is mild. I would say the bergamot and ylang ylang is a neutral smell, while the jasmine and patchouli are more flowery and a bit more feminine. Like I said, both are mild and after drying off my hands I can barely smell them already. One little pack fits into all my regular little inside purse pockets. I always keep soap on hand, especially since I’m allergic to most soaps kept in public restrooms and these soaps are great.",B09473GGM4,1626813268520,4.0
AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,My favorite sunscreen to use under makeup,"I love this sunscreen for under my makeup. It’s all I use it for because once it absorbs into my skin, it gives a non greasy look. No white cast either. It takes about 10 mins for it to fully sink into my skin and I’m able to apply my makeup. I like that it is able to absorb into my skin even after I put on a serum and a day cream. It doesn’t cause me to break out but adds a layer of moisture to my skin.",B08NJ5BTWG,1624542331048,5.0
AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,Face texture improved on my face,This is a good ampoule that has helped improve the texture of the skin on my face. I would say the only slight negative for me is that I still have to use an oil serum with it to help lock in my faces moisture all day. Even with applying a moisturizing cream afterwards. But I do live in a desert so most people might not need that extra help. I really don’t smell this when applying and it doesn’t clog my pores.,B08HRNPNR5,1620062687331,4.0
AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,Great on my sensitive skin!,I’ve been looking for a body brush like this and I’m so happy to have found this! This is exactly like my facial brush except on a bigger scale. This is a good back scrubber for my sensitive skin on a daily basis. Anything else I’ve tried to use on a daily has been too rough. This gives a great lather with liquid or bar soap. The rope helps with grip but I wish it was wrapped around a little bit longer for better grip. As is 4.5 stars,B08N9RT9YD,1619222115142,5.0
AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,Good beginners set but a bit expensive,"I like this set. The base and top coat work great with the poly gels. I’ve also tried it with other sets of base and top coats and it works fine with those too. The sets lasted a few weeks no problems. The only thing that I’m not a fan of, is the colors. It supposed to be the color that it is on the tube. I find that the colors look a bit different from the tube to the dot that I made on the stick, and then even bigger difference on my nails. For instance, the red tube. Looks like a lighter red on the dot. Then on my hands, it turned red orange(not color changing either). I didn’t finish with a top coat before I took a picture because I didn’t like the color at all and I ended up painting it over with gel nail polish. Really that’s the only on with such a big difference. The others are not a big difference but a bit more sheer than I expected. It is still good quality, so if you like the colors then this set is for you. A bit on the expensive side for the amount of poly gels you get, and I’m not a big fan of the colors so I wouldn’t reorder this.",B088TXBCB5,1614025865252,4.0
AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,Small amount an expensive mask,"Pretty costly for such a small amount. I got 3 masks out of this small container, so that about $13 per mask. There was a lack of safety seal on mine which makes me question the product. Did I see a big difference between this expensive mask and one that costs less? Nope, not even alittle difference. While I do like companies that are about being all natural, there are cheaper options that do the same. Very unlikely I would reorder this.",B07PCGSFGQ,1610920255129,2.0
AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,Big bar of soap,"This is a big bar of soap, and that helps mitigate the high cost of a single bar of soap if you feel like splurging. It smells nice and lathers really well by itself, with a cloth, sponge or a brush. Gives a nice clean feel but it does feel like it strips my skin a bit more than I would like.",B086N136NH,1608580116844,4.0
AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,It’s alright-more better as a facial cream cleanser,"Smells like fermented mango....like a mango daiquiri....definitely not what I expected it to smell like lol. At the time of my order, it was priced about $20. I’m glad they dropped it as I don’t think it’s worth that much. Very much a gentle cleanser, not so much good for a lather. I’m actual surprised this is a body wash. I think it has the consistency of a cream facial cleanser, and the bottle looks like one as well. And after a few uses trying it as a body wash and not really liking it, I really only use it on my face now. I don’t think I would reorder this.",B07YNDWRCB,1607715626042,3.0
AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,Worst polygel I’ve used yet,"First picture is the after, after a lot of work. Don’t let it fool you. Second picture is to just show that this white is really an off white, milky white. Third picture is 2 days later where 2 popped off. The next day the ring finger one broke in half. 🤦🏻‍♀️ This is my 7th set(of different sets and brands of polygel trying to find the best). Not my first rodeo. I know what I’m doing with polygels. Am I a professional? Nope. Just a mom doing my own nails at home. I love polygels as it gives me beautiful salon nails from home and can stand the abuse a regular mom can put it through (like cleaning and washing dishes without gloves,etc).<br /> I tried 4 different colors. They gave me an insight about the quality of this set. You only see 3 colors in the first pic, I know. But that’s because the clear is what I originally tried ( I really did try) to put on my middle finger instead of one of the glitters. Putting this set in the forms(I don’t use the forms from this set as I don’t like them), using solution to spread it in the forms was like any other polygel I’ve used. It’s when I turned it over and put it on my nails did something different happen. It basically started to ooze out of the forms way more than normal,it was getting messy. Putting it under the uv lamp to set it quickly. But as it was setting under the lamp the nails were falling a bit and setting that way. But it was the “clear” color that was the worst of the bunch. Oozed out so fast that it was un-salvageable. The way it oozed made me think of Buitee’s Starry sky set. But at least those were the specialty set, their regular ones were SOLID(even if I didn’t like some of the colors, that’s nothing on their quality). This set will probably work on nails like polish or something, but I love using the nail forms and this just doesn’t work, and didn’t stay ON. I don’t recommend this.",B08DHZW3LK,1605038256595,1.0
AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,Complete set not for beginners,"This is a complete set, not a full kit. There is a big difference. Saying that this is everything you need to make the nails if you have everything else. That means you already have the UV lamp, the base and top coat, and the solution and brush kit. From my experience, this kit is not for beginners. The glitter set aka starry sky set is messy and requires a lot of filing similar to biutees cat eye set. By hand, but filing with a nail drill is better. I was trying different looks to see if I can make some awesome looking Halloween (witchy) looking nails. This set alone is not it though. I might try experimenting with mixing this with biutees poly gels that might make it better and more manageable.",B086W18W1W,1602694040622,3.0
AFSQYNVKFMP3WWNXTFTNBFNU3EOA,Beautiful saloon nails,"This is just the poly gel. In order to use this for long nails you need nail forms, a solution, a container for the solution, and the brush with scrapper, and the UV lamp. Also the base coat and most likely a nail drill and some nails files (not shown in picture). ***Important*** You have to use a gel nail base coat before the poly gel in order for it to stick, otherwise they will pop off. If you don’t have these things, I would suggest you don’t get this for the first time. There are nail kits for that. And lots of YouTube videos to show how to do it. It’s how I learned to do mine. With a full set of long nails, and enough for extra nails and some fills, this one bottle could last for at least a couple months. This is a good amount of product for a reasonable price. $7 for nails for a couple months. And this nice color looks beautiful. It’s hardy nails like acrylic and gel nail polish in one.",B085QDWHQJ,1602090170843,5.0

AGPTRM72WHO5EUPQUWS47FFGAALA,5+ 🌟 - love this luxurious cream,"I received either a full size or deluxe sample of a Tula skincare product a few years ago when I got one of my first beauty box subscriptions. After using it, I think, is when I first fell in love with all things skincare! So thanks Tula lol! I was a little shocked at the price of Tula products but years later, after trying lots & lots of other skincare brands, I feel the price point for Tula skincare is worth it.<br /><br />I was very excited to see this ""super-sized"" 3.4 oz tub and I just had to try it. As with the other Tula products I have tried, this did not disappoint. If I could have rated it higher than 5 stars, I would have. It is a thick luxurious cream that glides on your face like silk and is quickly absorbed. It didn't leave my face feeling greasy or tacky,  just soft, hydrated & moisturized. Today is a non-makeup day for me & I am just going to enjoy the way my face feels after using this awesome cream.<br /><br />I will be purchasing this product when it's out, although you only need a little, so I'm assuming this tub will last a long time. I highly recommend this Tula product!",B08WF29DM9,1616168966258,5.0
AGPTRM72WHO5EUPQUWS47FFGAALA,Left my face feeling tight & dry,"I received 1.7 ounces of product in a plastic pump bottle. The product has a shimmery gold appearance & has a light, very pleasing scent.<br /><br />This product claims the following:  ""this unique effervescent mask delivers the essential benefits of oxygen to energize the skin and brighten dullness, instantly... Perfect to revive and rejuvenate dull, tired skin; it also replenishes moisture to give the skin a plump, dewy appearance.""<br /><br />I did my usual double cleanse and applied this product as directed by applying a thin layer to damp skin & left it on for 10 minutes. It sort of tickled my face as it began to bubble a little. I am not sure if my face was damp enough or if I didn't use enough product but the bubbly effect eased up & then the product dried a bit. After my time was up, I rinsed my face with warm water & I gently patted my skin dry. Usually this is when I would apply a toner but I wanted to feel my face once it was dry. I was hoping this product would replenish moisture to give my skin a plump & dewy finish. Unfortunately my skin felt tight & dry and left me feeling unimpressed because of this.<br /><br />For the price point & disappointing results, I cannot recommend this product.",B08VKQY815,1615243595061,3.0
AGPTRM72WHO5EUPQUWS47FFGAALA,High quality skincare for my aged skin,"I became a fan of the Murad brand after receiving different Murad products in my beauty box subscriptions over the past few years. The products I received in the past were high quality and, I feel, superior to other brands that I have tried with similar claims. This intense recovery cream does not disappoint.<br /><br />The thick & luxurious cream comes in a 1.7 ounce frosted glass tub and it is easily applied to my face & neck area. It has a very slight hygienic scent that quickly dissipates after application. The product immediately absorbed & left my skin feeling soothed & hydrated and never tacky or greasy. I have very sensitive skin and the cream caused my face no adverse reactions.<br /><br />Directions indicate to apply it to clean face, neck & chest morning and night. I use a variety of skincare serums depending on the time of day & the current condition of my skin and this cream played nicely with my other skin care products and make-up.<br /><br />Murad claims, ""Now, calm comes in a cream. Murad's Intense Recovery Cream is a clinically proven, comforting cream for face & eyes that reduces visible signs of stress-induced aging and redness. Microalgae extract smooths the look of facial tension and stress lines. Deeply moisturizes even severely dry skin as it relieves visible redness & encourages recovery.""<br /><br />Ingredients include Shea Butter & Macadamia Oil, Mirabilis Jalapa Plant Extract, Microalgae Extract.<br /><br />Included in this review are pictures of the literature on the box & tub for your review.<br /><br />I am very excited to add this Murad product to my collection of Murad skincare as I know I will enjoy using it as much as I enjoy using the other Murad skincare products I have in my arsenal.<br /><br />Having only used this now for a few days, this is a firstly impression review. I look forward to seeing a reduction in the redness on my face.<br /><br />Highly recommend ♡",B08SQZ1B3W,1614099409335,5.0

And I did, thanks to nail salons prior to the covid19 pandering. Once the pandemic hit I was still reluctant to go to a salon after they opened in limited capacity. I was determining to learn how to do them myself. I mistakenly ordered tips versus whole nails and because of this, these nail tips didn't work for me. That being said,  these tips are of excellent quality if you know how to make them work for you. Highly recommend if you do..",B08B3TCMSQ,1611784583380,5.0
AGPTRM72WHO5EUPQUWS47FFGAALA,"Awesome product, great results!","I am in love with skin care, more than ever in my life now that I in my 50s. I truly wish I started in my earlier years. And the newest & most exciting things in skin care are Korean skin care products. I had heard they were the best so I was excited to see this 2-step product & even more excited to try it. I will admit, I am a bit obsessed with face masks at the moment. I use a mask every day, especially during this pandemic while I am stuck at home & not able to go to a cosmetologist for a facial. I have aged & have dry skin with lots of fine wrinkles appearing around the corners of my eyes and a deep nasolabial fold forming. I am saddened every time Iook at my reflection in the mirror. I absolutely love this 2-step product. I opened one end of the product & applied the small masks to my eyes & around my mouth (4 to a pack) and then applied the whole face mask (step 2) over it all. I left them all on according to the directions and my face felt amazing afterwards. I was so pleased with the way my face felt that I was already looking forward to the next time I used this product. Btw, my face is very sensitive to skin care products & this particular product did not cause me any redness, irritation,  peeling or burning.

AHBWH2LBU3NFLD46GKJKIBAHKXEQ,Nope nope nope!,"I've used many different brands of nail polish removers in my lifetime, ranging from acetone, to non-acetone, to soy-based, to mineral. This, by far, is the WORST one I've ever used. Here are the pros: the bottle is great. The non spill bottle is convenient and will prevent nasty tip overs that could prevent damage to floors or furniture. This also doesn't have a chemical smell that other polish removers tend to have. Here are the cons: This doesn't remove polish! I tried this on my Color Street glitter and solid nail strips. They are regular polish and I also used this on normal glitter AND solid color Sally Hansen polish. Nothing came off. It was like using water. Actually, it was like using oily water. This left an oily film on my nails that I actually had to scrub with rubbing alcohol to remove. If you want a natural nail polish remover that works, try Ella and Mia.",B08NC4378M,1624015178440,2.0
AHBWH2LBU3NFLD46GKJKIBAHKXEQ,"A good, basic kit for gel polish removal","I found most of this kit to be helpful in removing the gel polish that I wear. The nail polish remover clips help soften the polish and make removal a breeze. They have held up to multiple uses and feel like they will last for a long time to come. The polish scraping tool has also held up well. It is sturdy, easy to hold, and scraped the surface of the polish off easily. The metal doesn't bend and cleans easily with remover, followed by soap and water. The files haven't held up too well, however. Maybe I'm just a bit too rough on them, but I've worn through two of them already. I have spares on hand, but I wish they would have held up a bit better. Overall, the kit is decent, and for the price you receive some decent quality tools for at home removal.",B08CZ5JZMZ,1620986704258,4.0
AHBWH2LBU3NFLD46GKJKIBAHKXEQ,Not quite right for my skin,"I use a lot of face masks, and in terms of performance, these were middle of the road. The masks themselves were a bit too ""wet"" for my taste right out of the sleeve. I had to gently wring them before application. Even after use there was still a lot of serum on my face. It didn't moisturize as much as it felt a bit too wet. If your skin is super dry, though, this may be what you need!

I recently found that hyaluronic acid works  best to not only clear my skin, but keep it clear. The WIS line of skincare products has helped keep my skin healthy and free of breakouts for several months now. These masks have helped immensely. They tackle the breakouts at the source, while moisturizing my skin and not building up oils. These masks are lightweight and feel sheer enough to allow my skin to breathe. They are still thick enough to lock in treatment and the medication. For the price, these are a fantastic deal and last me for a little more than a month since I only use them twice a week.

I have combination skin that tends to flare up with cystic acne and dry skin all at once. The hyaluronic acid in the WIS brand helps keep my skin balanced and clear. To begin, these masks are comfortable and thick, staying put where I need them to during treatment. They don't slip off or slide. The medication absorbscquivkly after removal and leaves my face feeling soft, smooth, and moisturized. Considering I use these three times a week, the 24 packnis the best value for my money.

Once I was able to separate them and use them individually in homemade bath bombs, though, the smell improved and really took off. It seemed that the process of rehydrating the flowers is what made the smell improve.

The masks are thick enough to stretch and hold all the solution required for an effective treatment. They moisturize well and left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. They are a bit more on the expensive side, but considering how much damage these helped, I felt they were a good value for the order.

AHBWH2LBU3NFLD46GKJKIBAHKXEQ,A gentle mask that softened my skin.,"My skin can sometimes flare with dryness and redness. This mask was able to reduce both in one application.

I am a size 9 in women's shoes. They're sheer enough to not feel binding, but thick enough to hold the solution. It was a little hard to position the tape to keep the liquid from spilling, so I had to keep repositioning it. The solution smelled nice and washed clean after the treatment. The peeling started about a week after wearing. At this time, be sure to gently exfoliate and moisturize. DON'T peel the skin. You could hurt yourself. Overall, I did notice a difference and my feet did feel softer. I'll be doing the second treatment soon.",B07SY7WPS4,1609923207141,4.0

I got the cherry scent, but it doesn't smell anything like cherry blossoms. It just smells sickly and artificial. Maybe I got a bad batch. I couldn't stand to use this.

I've been trying to avoid alcohol hand sanitizers because they have a tendency to dry my hands and make them bleed. I've had luck with natural hand wipes because they don't flare my eczema or my children's eczema. Every package of these hand wipes we opened smelled spoiled and had brown streaks that looked like mold. I ended up throwing away the rest of the package because I simply didn't feel safe using the product. I don't recommend this at all.,B08DK74M1P,1607149967190,1.0

AHBWH2LBU3NFLD46GKJKIBAHKXEQ,Flimsy curlers that rip easy,"I was intrigued by these spiral curlers when I saw them. I've used foam rollers occasionally in the past with fair results, so I thought these might work as well. These do curl, but they aren't great. First of all, these take some practice to get in. Take small strands of hair, or you will cause tangling. I recommend doing this after a shower. I left mine in overnight. They were easy to remove and didn't cause any pain. The curls were a bit... Overwhelming. It was an 80's nightmare, actually. To top it off, the curlers didn't hold up well, either, and most of them had holes and tore after one use. This probably won't be a curler set I'll be using again.",B08BLKFGND,1599608387792,3.0
AHBWH2LBU3NFLD46GKJKIBAHKXEQ,Good alternative to travel emery boards,"I try to avoid using traditional files and emery boards on my nails. I take a lot of medications that make my nails weak and brittle, and any surface that's too abrasive wreaks havoc on my fingertips. I can't carry a full size glass nail file with me everywhere, so I was on the hunt for a travel sized file that could fit in my pocket, wallet, or purse. When these came up, I thought I'd give them a shot. The pros are the files are a great size, they're packaged well, and I see them lasting for awhile. The case they come in is a nice touch, and I enjoyed the fact there were two so I could have a spare. They're pretty to look at, if that matters to you. They'd make great little stocking stuffers or gifts. There were a few con's to the files, but nothing too major. The abrasive side is only on one side of the file. I prefer to have options on the level of abrasiveness, so this was a little disappointing. In addition, the abrasive side didn't do all that great a job filing down my nails. It will do in a pinch, and it's not my favorite file, but for emergency use, it will do. If you need a glass file for travel purposes, this is the best option I have found so far, despite the minor drawbacks.",B088TGQFNM,1598253699483,4.0

I love the small detail brush which is my new go to for reverse stamping nail art which I do a LOT.<br /><br />The edges do discolor a bit if you use acetone on the actual handle. I would suggest using non acetone cleaner on brushes (always!). These brushes have nice plastic to surround the bristles, which I would suggest keeping to make sure they always dry in the right shape.<br /><br />Overall, I love these brushes. They are comparable to my more expensive brushes, and have a great variety for striping, detailing, etc. there’s also a nice variety of dotting tools.",B08B3SJNL5,1603657036777,5.0
AERJSFYTGI6ACY5VSOYQ5RAN6QFQ,"Easy to use, gorgeous colors","This polygel set is surprisingly delightful.  When it comes to the gels alone: they have a very nice smooth texture that is easy to manipulate and use.  They fill the dual forms nicely, but also are able to move and smooth well enough to use the nail extension wraps instead.  The have enough give in them to allow for some self leveling, and dry easily in about 60-90 seconds a side (I always dry under LED on the top then flip the finger and get the underside of the extension just to make sure it solidifies perfectly).  Once dry, they are able to very nicely file down and smooth in place, which is great considering some are truly jam backed with various sized glitters.  They need a good wipe down with alcohol after cooking though, having a fair amount of tacky surface, but that's fine with me.<br /><br />The cremes are fairly solid in color, and opaque.  I love the various pinks, and the white is a nice solid color that isn't too harsh making it perfect for a nice soft french tip.  The #03 pink is a great neutral and classic pink color, which is great for either a base color for extensions or for turning into a french tip with the white.<br /><br />As for the glitters, they are nice and shiny.  My only complaint is I wish the matrixes had a touch more color added to them.  The various colors of glitters make it clear what the effect/color  should be, I just think they would pack a bit more punch if there was a bit more dye in the matrix.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice set.  Keep in mind, all the bottles are small except for the #3 pink.  But its a nice little starter kit, and the glitter is a nice addition.  I'll definitely keep these in mind going forwards!",B08DHZW3LK,1603432593966,5.0
AERJSFYTGI6ACY5VSOYQ5RAN6QFQ,Hello curls!,"I have major issues with curling my hair.  I am TERRIBLE at it.  I struggle with a curling iron, and never seem to get uniform curls.  I also have very straight and fine blonde hair that does not naturally hold any sort of shape besides straight.<br /><br />These curlers do the trick, and they aren't uncomfortable to sleep on like I was expecting.  Now I take a shower before I go to bed, apply the curlers with the easy to use wand, and go to bed.  By the morning I can pull these out of my hair easily, and find that I have beautiful tight curls that I can set with hair spray or brush lightly before applying spray.  If I do not apply spray they last for about 2 hours, but if I apply a good light weight hairspray they last the entire workday.  I also do not have any issues with any kinks or lines in the curls, even at the top, which is a HUGE plus.<br /><br />Overall these units apply easily to my damp hair using the attached wand, and curl the hair nicely.",B087FTZSZH,1603278520698,5.0
AERJSFYTGI6ACY5VSOYQ5RAN6QFQ,Tips are very weak,"I've gone back and forth on these.  On one hand, they are very cost effective, and you get four rhinestone pickers instead of one which is a huge plus.<br /><br />However, I find I go through the soft end of the rhinestone picker faster than I do other units.  For instance, I have one rhinestone picker from UberChic beauty which I have had for over 6 months, and it still maintains its original shape and is only showing slight dulling at the tip.  However, these units are very soft on the white end, and have actually chipped/worn away quickly.  In a month and a half I have already used up one and the majority of a second.<br /><br />They do a good job at what they are meant for, and I have not had any issues at all with picking up rhinestones.  However, the white end is just too soft, and considering tips have broken off/worn away so quickly I have to give this 3/5.",B085RQKWNF,1603277858332,3.0
AERJSFYTGI6ACY5VSOYQ5RAN6QFQ,Great beginner sets!,"To start with: this is an actual great little starter kit.  This offers people the opportunity to play with both gel and polygel, while coming with a small light.  Being honest - when I first started working with gel I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, so a kit like this would have been super helpful.<br /><br />The gels themselves have nice self leveling.  The colors are nicely pigmented two coaters.  They are fairly tacky, so make sure you put on a top coat (which I always recommend) or be prepared to wipe down with alcohol.  They do take a bit longer to set, but they do set nicely.<br /><br />The sequins are a nice touch, and the top coat and base coats are very close quality to others I have (similar to Beetles).  The top coat isn't quite a no wipe, but it shines up beautifully with a little bit of alcohol.<br /><br />The tools are perfect, and the polygel colors are beautiful.  They set nicely, and file perfectly.  The duoforms are in lots of good sizes, so I don't have any issues finding the perfect sizes (my hands are weird, each finger has different size which is annoying to need 10 different sizes, but hey.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why there's the nail foils since there's no glue for the foils.  The top coat isn't quite tacky enough for foils.  The striping tape is a very nice touch.<br /><br />The light works fairly well.  The onyl problem is its a one button, so its only 45 seconds or 60 seconds.  I have a lot of other lights, so while I was happy to try this one out, and it'll be great for travel, I like my bigger lights for other  daily use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little kit for trying out gels and polygels.  I would advise that you pick up more files and a bigger light in the future with more settings and timers, but overall, this is great for getting started.  The travel case fits everything nicely, and makes it convenient to take on vacation.  The gels also last about 2 weeks which is a huuuuuge plus.",B087GB8ZRF,1600628588672,5.0

They do take a bit longer to set, but they do set nicely.<br /><br />The sequins are a nice touch, and the top coat and base coats are very close quality to others I have (similar to Beetles).  The top coat isn't quite a no wipe, but it shines up beautifully with a little bit of alcohol.<br /><br />The tools are perfect, and the polygel colors are beautiful.  They set nicely, and file perfectly.  The duoforms are in lots of good sizes, so I don't have any issues finding the perfect sizes (my hands are weird, each finger has different size which is annoying to need 10 different sizes, but hey.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why there's the nail foils since there's no glue for the foils.  The top coat isn't quite tacky enough for foils.  The striping tape is a very nice touch.<br /><br />The light works fairly well.  The onyl problem is its a one button, so its only 45 seconds or 60 seconds.  I have a lot of other lights, so while I was happy to try this one out, and it'll be great for travel, I like my bigger lights for other  daily use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little kit for trying out gels and polygels.  I would advise that you pick up more files and a bigger light in the future with more settings and timers, but overall, this is great for getting started.  The travel case fits everything nicely, and makes it convenient to take on vacation.  The gels also last about 2 weeks which is a huuuuuge plus.",B087G54FLM,1600628548817,5.0

AHXL6HSB4XCGSXWTGDHXNFDAMDDA,I wish there was more,So the container itself isn't very big and I wish there was more. I have bleach blonde hair that is very thin but I have a lot of it. I have to use quite a bit of product to get it to cover my entire head. It is very thick so you really have to use a ton of product. I use it twice a week and let it sit for 10 minutes before washing out. I have noticed that my hair isn't as frizzy and I don't have as many fly aways when I wear my hair up. The scent is very fresh and light; husband approved. My reason for the 4/5 stars is just because I was anticipating much more product than I received.,B07L9H27SH,1623095194038,4.0
AHXL6HSB4XCGSXWTGDHXNFDAMDDA,large enough for an entire hand including your thumb,"Finally, a UV light that I can fit my entire hand in including my thumb! The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the package was the multiple power ports on the back of the unit. It comes with a cable already to plug into any outlet but I guess if you wanted to use your own cord you could. I ended up plugging my nail drill/file into the back of the unit so I didn't have multiple things to plug into separate outlets. The lights go around the entire inside of the dome so you don't have to worry about your hand being flat. It has 3 different settings on the top for 30/60/90 seconds. I just watched the timer on the top of the unit that counts up every time you put your hand or foot in. I like that the entire unit is plastic and not metal. The light also shuts off when you remove your hand. Very nice and look forward to doing my nails again!",B08MT8L5ZL,1613408451591,5.0
AHXL6HSB4XCGSXWTGDHXNFDAMDDA,first time,"I have seen a ton of social media posts about these poly gel kits and figured I would give it a try. I am not a professional at all and can barely paint my own nails. I watched a couple of YouTube videos before giving this a try and I didn't do terrible! Here are some pointers for those of you that are trying this out for the first time.<br />1) you need to have a uv/led curing light. You start with the clear base and cure it before applying the gel. Apply the gel and cure, then apply the top coat and cure.<br />2) thick but not too thick!- If you make it too thin, the tips will just bend and break off. You need to make sure that you are putting it on about the consistency of the plastic nail that you use to apply the gel.<br />3) Don't forget to fix the bottom of the nail tip before you cure. If you don't do this you will have a giant glob of hardened get that you will need to file down.<br />4) If you don't want an ombre effect, you will need to make sure that the thickness is consistent from the top to the bottom of the nail.<br />5) Have a few disposable nail files. The giant one that comes with the kit isn't my favorite because it is quite bulky. I used a few coarse nail files to really get the shape that I wanted.<br /><br />The kit itself is nicely put together, I just wish there were directions with it. You will need to have a lamp, nail file, cuticle cutter, and nail trimmers to accomplish your finished nails which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.",B088TXBCB5,1610542409313,4.0
AHXL6HSB4XCGSXWTGDHXNFDAMDDA,The extras make it worth it,My favorite part of this is the sticky hooks that come with it. I tried putting body wash on it but it's a bit tricky to do.

AGPCJNECQMG7LPLITZVHXP3F2HUA,Cat eye gel nails are amazing!,"Pine gel nail polish smells great, looks amazing, and lasts a long time.  The dark blue is our favorite color and we love that you can get the deep color with great glitter and shine using just one coat, on top of the base coat.  There are no base or top coats included, but as long as you have them, the set, along with a nail clipper and file is all you need to have salon quality manicure and pedicure.  The magnet included with the kit is rectangular, as shown, and is effective at making long streaks on the nails.  With some practice, you’ll be able to create very defined cat eyes, but make sure you keep the cure lights right nearby, or you’ll lose the streaking.  Additionally, make sure that you buff the nails lightly, clean the nails thoroughly, and run full cure times if you want to have the nail polish last more than two weeks.  Following this simple procedure will hopefully give you a high quality and long lasting finish like I have experienced.  I recommend Pine Gel Nail Polish and am sure you’ll be super happy with the results.",B085TFXLH1,1626758924969,5.0
AGPCJNECQMG7LPLITZVHXP3F2HUA,Dark and glittery finish that provides top notch nails!,"Pine produces great gel polishes that last and that look amazing.  The gel nail polishes also smell great, like I’ve been working on a Christmas tree.  The colors in this set are some of our favorites.  The dark green and the dark glittery blue are our favorites.  We find it best to apply more than one coat, although Pine is not incorrect in advertising that one coat is essentially equal to two of those from other companies.  The chameleon set’s colors look amazing and although not exactly like the stickers on the top of the polishes, they still are good enough to tell which is which.  The different colors are a great combination and allow for salon quality finishes.  I have found the Pine gel nail polishes last a very long time when you properly prepare your nails before application, and when you allow the polish to have sufficient cure times.  I have also found that my nail beds are less beat up when using the Pine products.  The color options and long lasting finish of Pine is hard to beat, and I strongly recommend this product and brand.",B085SY4WC3,1626758859813,5.0
AGPCJNECQMG7LPLITZVHXP3F2HUA,"Color Kit 3- Beautiful colors, long-lasting finish, but poor marketing job","Manicures and pedicures are a routine event in our home, especially with restrictions on public outings.  With younger children, picking nail polish is a given, so despite the gel’s potential to last for up to two weeks, they manage to remove it in just a few days.  For them, though, it means another nail session and new colors, so no big deal.  The gel nail polish was hopefully our answer to increase the duration and longevity of their finished nails.<br /><br />Anzuo Gel Nail Polish offers attractive color kits.  We received the Kit 3 set, which contains black, red, white, and three shades of tan to brown.  Like others have commented, the lids only contain numbers, and the kit includes stickers where the user has to create the swatches.  This is an inconvenience, but not the end of the world.  We found it to be a good test to see how the gel polish would actually apply and then finish.<br /><br />The gel was rather thick, even after keeping it at room temperature, and rolling it to ensure sufficient mixing.  With thinner and increased coats, the polish results in deep, beautiful colors that we really enjoy.  The white looks like white-out, even with a top clear coat, though.  The black and red are the favorites in our home.<br /><br />The main problem we experienced and shared with others is the inconsistency and deficiencies in the product’s marketing.  There are typos, poor translation and grammar, and worse yet, is the inconsistency in the cure times advertised by the company on the Amazon site and the actual shipping box.  The box says cure time is 10-30 seconds by LED/UV lamp, but the website says time frames up to 120 seconds.  That is a huge difference that seriously impacts the quality and life of the nail finish.  We cure using time frames of 60-120 seconds, depending upon the wattage used by our lamp.  With these longer cure times, we have been able to keep the polish looking well and intact for over a week now, even on our children’s nails.<br /><br />If you can overlook the need to label the bottles, disregard the spelling and grammatical errors, and then utilize your own cure times, the Anzuo gel polish is worth using.",B0876VC4KM,1604163791789,4.0
AGPCJNECQMG7LPLITZVHXP3F2HUA,Beautiful blue bottles but nozzle cap turns loose,"We are always looking for a plain water bottle for use on clothes or hair, and these blue glass bottles are the perfect solution!  The two-pack of spray bottles both provide a consistent spray mist, and also a targeted spray, based upon which setting the tip is turned to.Tight seal on caps, until you try and turn the spray nozzle.  When you turn it, it loosens the cap, and occurs on both bottles. The black labels stay secured through washing and the black color doesn’t detract from the deep blue color of the bottle.  We have been using both for water, but we are going to make one be an air freshener bottle using our essential oils.  After a quick test run with the oils, made extra convenient using one of the plastic filters that comes with each bottle, as long as they were diluted, the spray nozzle was able to provide an even and broad mist.  With two sprays in the playroom, it smelled like a citrus orchard, but didn’t leave the carpet feeling saturated.  We are happy with the bottles, except that the lid comes undone when adjusting the spray nozzle.  Just be careful to re-secure so you don’t spill water or whatever else you may put in the bottles.",B089ZQ8Y95,1601660902017,4.0

AFNACT4MLU243POBVE666TFVUPGQ,HUSABND HAPPY NO SCALP IRRITATION,"My husband recently switched from liquid shampoos to bars and now prefers them. He made the switch after trying several liquid shampoos that not only didn't help his thinning dry hair they irritated his scalp.<br /><br />Garnier, being a well known brand, I wanted him to try this one and right now its his #2 choice from the 4 he's tried.  It hasn't irritated his scalp and he's so far happy with how his thinning, fine hair looks and feels.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and I hope this review is helpful",B0941YDPSW,1627495309566,4.0
AFNACT4MLU243POBVE666TFVUPGQ,NOT A SKINCARE GIMMICK GIVES AMAZING RESULTS,"My first thought was that this was another gimmick but being a skincare junkie had to try it. I'm so glad that I did as it exceeded my expectations to the point that I've overlooked a few things I'd normally dock it on.<br /><br />First use: My usual routine is to wash my makeup off and immediately apply HA [Hyaluronic acid] to relieve the resulting dry tight feeling.  I filled this sprayer with HA serum and at first, didn't feel anything but cool air hitting my face and wondered if any serum was even coming out. Then suddenly the tightness was gone and my face felt like it was covered with a moisture mask. When applying HA with my fingers it always took a minute or two to soak in, not so with this sprayer the results were immediate! Although the Nano mist is so fine its impossible to see, the end results is an amazing feeling of soft fully moisturized skin.<br /><br />With this sprayer you can chose to use serums, toners or water so your not limited to only water like other Nano sprayers. This sprayer is well made and the USB cord is included, the liquid chamber is small [perhaps two tablespoon capacity] easy to fill and it only used a tiny amount of serum to cover my face and neck.<br /><br />The only Cons are the USB port's location on the bottom so it must be laid on its side to charge {that's weird} and the instruction booklet could use a little help. But, as stated at the beginning of this review I'm so impressed with how my skin feels I'm forgiving the aforementioned transgressions and giving this a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't normally get excited about skin care tools but this one is an exception and its made me a Nano spray believer. Highly recommend.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.",B09671G4KH,1626725876602,5.0
AFNACT4MLU243POBVE666TFVUPGQ,NICE NATURAL LOOKING REASONABLE PRICE,"These are natural looking lashes that were easy to apply. The magnetic liner's brush is tapered to a point allowing me to make a thin less noticeable line that stayed put all day. The lashes removed easily and the liner was gone with one swipe of Micellar Water. My only complaint is that it did seem to take a while for the liner to dry, but then I'm a newbie at magnetic lashes so this may not be out of the ordinary.",B08KJF6Y6C,1609792569115,4.0
AFNACT4MLU243POBVE666TFVUPGQ,SMILE LINES NOW LESS NOTICEABLE,"I just started using this filler and at this time I don't feel its had the appropriate time for me to see any change in the depth of my fine lines. So this will be a 1st impression review that I will revisit after I've used this for a few weeks.<br /><br />[From the box/packaging] This product is made by the Korean,  Daewoong Pharmaceutical [DN Co.] Company which according to the company's website is a global healthcare company that strives to contribute to the beauty molding industry in Korea and around the world.<br /><br />The gel has an easy to use unique packaging that doses out just the right amount needed to pat over wrinkles and fine lines. The gel, when first applied, feels slightly sticky but does not remain so on the skin and it worked well under foundation with no pilling or reaction.<br /><br />Being a skin care/cosmetic junkie and always a bit skeptical,  I did a little digging into the ingredients. It does contain proven HA [hyaloronic acid] which is a good start in my opinion. I did find one ingredient I wanted to know more about namely:<br /><br />EGF [epidermal growth factor) a/k/a SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1: - From the INCI website - Epidermal growth factor is a protein that stimulates cell growth.  I encourage you to research this ingredient for additional information for informed decision making.<br /><br />Right now, I'm skeptically giving this 3 stars for seemingly falling into the Cosmeceuticals [cosmetic products that claimed to have medicinal or drug-like benefits]<br /><br />11/29/20 Update:  I've used this for a few weeks now and my smile lines, although not doing a disappearing act,  they are less noticeable. I've not had any adverse reaction to this gel and have added a star due to the results I've seen. Note : a little goes a long way.",B07VDCD17L,1605729213671,4.0
AFNACT4MLU243POBVE666TFVUPGQ,WORTHY OF A TRY FOR STAYING POWER ALONE PLUS- No Racoon Eyes!,"First off I wear contact lens and so far I've had no adverse reaction. I've only tried it once and it stayed put for 24 hrs, even though a shower! Now that's what I call really waterproof! I don't normally sleep in makeup of any kind but wanted to give it an ""all night"" durability test. Woke up the next morning....was still there! Expected at least some ""mascara"" marks on my pillowcase but there was nary a mark. But my biggest surprise came when I awoke without ""racoon eyes""!!! I usually wear ""tubing"" mascaras as other formulas end up under my eyes within a few hours, I actually expected this mascara to do the same.<br /><br />Volume and length? It definitely added length.  I use Latisse so my lashes have stayed long as I've aged and this mascara provided additional length.  As to volume,  not so much.  However, I only used one coat so it may indeed give the volume advertised with another coat. I really did not notice any ""fibers"" and being a lens wearer perhaps that's not a bad thing.  The formula is not thick so it applies smoothly without leaving clumps. It was fairly easy to remove  with a cotton pad soaked in micro-cellular water.  All in all, if you are looking for staying power this mascara is worthy of a try.<br /><br />The packaging is unique! Hans Holbein's portrait of a young Princess Elizabeth [later Queen Elizabeth I] just caught my eye. I found the square shape vs round tube a lot easier to hold and the brush is a standard design found on many other mascara brands.",B086ST4W1C,1595522699168,5.0
AGZSDSHEGWQOJZAJRXGXXV4FULIA,Excellent pack of hair towels!,"I have curly/wavy hair that I like to use microfiber towels on because it reduces frizziness. These towels are EXCELLENT, I really really like them. Both designs are really great for ""plopping"" if any curly-haired girls are familiar with the term. And my hair comes out so great when I let it initially dry in one of these. I finish it off with a blow dryer with a diffuser but this gets out all the excess moisture and being able to put it up really keeps it out of my way. It came with a couple of scrunchies as well. And the gray and white stripes are really cute. I'd definitely recommend this towel pack!",B0841WQNNZ,1607533269651,5.0
AGZSDSHEGWQOJZAJRXGXXV4FULIA,Do not recommend,"Maybe it’s just my hair, but this was impossible to use. I had freshly washed, wet, combed through hair and could not get a small piece through one of these things. It was SO painful and tangled halfway through. It did not work at all. I tried several times to just do one before giving up so I can’t say how well they curl. Maybe someone with very thin hair this would work but I still think the shape of the curlers is all wrong, the opening is entirely too thin to be effective. I liked the idea of no heat curling by just letting your hair dry inside of a curl shape but I do not recommend this product at all.",B08BLKFGND,1600726019995,1.0

They have just enough stretch to make it easy to do a bun but are not too stretchy that they stretch out. They easily retain their original size. I absolutely love the variety of colors, most hair ties come in just brown and black but these are so versatile! They also come in an excellent bag that keeps them all organized instead of just randomly in a drawer, and the box is nice enough that it could be a pre-wrapped gift. Excellent presentation. I highly highly recommend these and will never buy the ""normal"" kind of hair tie again.",B07YL4485K,1600389105510,5.0

I also love the little case they came in, I'll definitely be using it to keep them organized instead of scattered all around in a drawer. I use these all the time and would buy more colors!",B081D2R47W,1600388788122,5.0
AGZSDSHEGWQOJZAJRXGXXV4FULIA,This kit is EXCELLENT!,"I love this kit! I was a little skeptical when I ordered it but figured it couldn't hurt to try. It more than exceeded my expectations! I love everything it comes with - 4 gel polishes plus base and top coat, 3 ""extension"" gels that I haven't tried yet but seem awesome, nail foil in a variety of patterns, an LED light, file, buffer, brush, design tape, glitter, plus the case to keep it all neat and together. I tried out the polish and it works awesome! Easy to apply, and dries instantly. I feel like I went to the salon but for so much cheaper! My nails really look great. If I have one complaint it's the the light has to be plugged in to use, its not rechargeable. But overall I am so so pleased with this kit. It's going to be hard to go back to regular polish after this, and the price point makes it hard to justify going to the salon. Highly recommend!",B087G54FLM,1596567280062,5.0
AFPQJSBCMEKL3PT54KPROBQ2TAXA,So disappointed,"I'm disappointed with this poly gel kit. I tried using the clear one first and had so much problems with trying to mold it into the nail former with slip solution. Then I tried the deep pink and didn't like how it came out. I did the light pink and it came out super nicely, but less than 24 hours later 9 out of 10 came off. Didn't do anything differently with my nail prep or the base coat I use so I'm confused and overly disappointed about how and why 9 of them came off my nails. The poly gels are thick and really easy to use. The kit comes in really pretty colors including 2 glitter poly gel. I just hate that it didn't last long.",B08DHZW3LK,1607388606585,3.0
AFPQJSBCMEKL3PT54KPROBQ2TAXA,"Love it, growth and curling at the same time.",Such a great eyelash serum and I so love that it's in the form of an eyelash brush versus the thin brushes I've used in the past. I feel like using the eyelash brush is way better and applies more evenly than anything else and I'm able to get my lashes from the root to the end of the lash with the serum. Be careful though because I low key poked myself with the brush in both eyes once lol. I've noticed growth since using this eyelash serum and I've been using it for the past 2 weeks twice a day. I also like how I'm killing two birds with one stone by using the serum and also curling my lashes at the same time. I've used it with my contacts on and had not problems with the serum or brush.,B08J7R5HHX,1607219001039,5.0
AFPQJSBCMEKL3PT54KPROBQ2TAXA,Thick polish but not too thick,"These polishes are thick and only truly require one coat to cure and be done. I love that the colors are on the top of the bottles for you to know which one you're using. I forgot to use the magnet to get the cat eye effect but will try it later before curing the polish. I like the various shades of blues and purples in the set. Despite how thick it is, it only took one time to cure and dry which is a huge plus since you have to wait a while for a thick regular polish to dry.",B085TFXLH1,1606464976319,5.0
AFPQJSBCMEKL3PT54KPROBQ2TAXA,Love it,"These tips were so easy to apply, file, and shape. I love using them. I needed them to cover my nails so I can use the min dipping powder. They worked exceptionally well. I was able to file them down to look like my normal nails would and the powder was able to apply and bond to them well. I also tried gel nail polish over a few of them and the gel also bonded to the nails well. They felt really light and very flexible once I clipped and filed them. Pretty sure I can use these for a lot more versus the full cover nails. BTW that's my pointer finger not my middle finger in the single finger picture.",B08B3TCMSQ,1604607333431,5.0
AFPQJSBCMEKL3PT54KPROBQ2TAXA,Nice sturdy emery board,"I was able to use this emery  board on both my natural nails, poly gel, and acrylic nails when I wanted to shape or file them down. Very comfortable to hold and use. I was able to use one side for my natural nails (180) and the other side for the acrylic and poly gel nails (100). There are a lot in the pack so I'll be using them for a while without having to worry about running out of them. I like how the 100 side works really well to file/shape the acrylic/poly gel nails and the 180 side is gentle enough for my natural nails. Definitely a must have for your manicures.",B08C72C56Z,1603656341557,5.0
AFPQJSBCMEKL3PT54KPROBQ2TAXA,Love these glass spray bottles,"I'm used to putting my hair oils in plastic bottles and notice that a lot of times they leak out, how I'm not exactly sure. I was a little concerned that if I put my hair oil in one of these glass spray bottles it may not spray like it should and I'd have to figure something else out or continue to have leaking plastic bottles. Little did I know that these would work and work well. I love the idea of the tiny funnel which helped make sure none of the oil spilled and went directly into the bottle. I like the little chalkboard like labels which I used on both bottles. I used to other bottle for my leave in moisturizing conditioner and it works like a charm. I have to be a little more careful with the bottles as they are glass and I'm not used to using glass spray bottles. The spray nozzle has the option to stop it from spraying and two ways it can spray, shower or stream. The bottles are very lightweight even after you add content inside of it. You can use either the spray nozzle or the cap to keep things sealed, options for your desired use. Love these.",B089ZQ8Y95,1602440961657,5.0
AFPQJSBCMEKL3PT54KPROBQ2TAXA,Such a nice color,"I like this poly gel a little better than the one I've used previously. I will say I'm disappointed because according to the description/title this is supposed to be a kit. To me a kit comes with more than just one item. Well all I received was the poly gel. Aside from that, I love the color, although I could have used a little more on a few of my nails. The tube is rather small, but I still have enough left for at last two more manicures....I think. I ended up using gel polish over the poly gel but next time I think I will just wear it by itself. It took well to the polish and looks fabulous. It also has a nice shine/polish to it and it's very easy to file/shape.",B085QDWHQJ,1600718129570,5.0
AFPQJSBCMEKL3PT54KPROBQ2TAXA,It'll suffice,"I used this for the heels of my feet and wasn't thoroughly impressed. You have to lightly place it on your feet for the roller to go over the area you want. Putting too much pressure will cause it to stop in place. There are three different  grinder heads from soft to rough, but I didn't feel as though one was more effective than the other. I do like how easy it was to switch form one grinder head to the other and the concept and idea of the grinder heads. It had to be charged for about an hour when I initially opened the box.",B08BRS98SF,1596152574961,4.0
AFPQJSBCMEKL3PT54KPROBQ2TAXA,Very effective,"I used the foot peel mask exactly two days ago. As you can see my feet are already peeling. My thumbs and pointer fingers began peeling yesterday because I used them to open up the socks to put my feet in. A pair of booties come attached so you have to carefully cut them apart and then cut them open before you can separate it to put on. You have to make sure there's a cotton like barrier on each side of the booties before you put your foot in. Hence my thumb and pointer fingers peeling. I must say that this peel mask is way more effective than the one I used twice from Walmart. This one works a lot faster than the ones I've used before. I also like the fact that you get two pairs of them and they even include a callus shaver tool. I love the smell of lavender when you open up the mask even before you put them on. There's a tab on the side of the booties to peel and fold over so that the they are securely on your feet. Pretty nice idea considering the last feet mask, I used you had to put socks on over them to make sure 1. I didn't fall while moving around and 2. they don't slip off. The tabs make sure they stay in place and I was able to walk in them with my house shoes on. I wore them for an hour and washed the solution off my feet which were very soft afterwards. I did notice that my feet were a little dry feeling after a while but still soft. This is going to be added to my pandemic self care routine....and probably post pandemic.",B087Z9X39L,1596151466643,5.0

Nice even coating and I would recommend 2 normal coats for the best look.<br /><br />The set or cure times are no different then any other gel polish I have worked with.  I used a matte finish top coat on the green (lime) color and loved it.<br /><br />Overall, would recommend to others.",B08HZ5Y8RY,1607356658961,5.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,"Nice scrub, ultra heavy on scent","This is a fantastic scrub.  Feels wonderful on your skin, washes clean and really works.  The scent is really fantastic, but cherry blossom is one of my favorites.  This does lean into the heavily scented category though.  Not everyone likes or can be around super perfumed items.  If that is the case then this isn't for you.  It does slowly fade over the day/evening but it is there.<br /><br />Price point seems reasonable and I do really like the squeeze bottle vs the jars this type of bath product typically comes in.",B07PZ8JNWJ,1606306893831,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Nice colors,"This is a cool set.  If you don't care for the cat eye design you can still use this polish like anything else.  The polish is pretty thick so if you apply a thick coat you can pretty much get away with 1 coat.  The magnets aren't super strong, but they don't seem any weaker then other brands that offer a cats eye effect nail product.<br /><br />Set times are the same as any other gel polish under the UV/LED light.  I do find that even after letting this polish cure for 90 sec, if I don't apply a top coat then it always had a slightly tacky feel.  Not really uncommon but I have used some brands that don't do that so wanted to point it out.<br /><br />Overall, really nice set.",B085TFXLH1,1606137323583,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Can be clear or dark background,This is a nice set of polish for anyone that loves shimmering polish.  You get 5 shimmer polishes and 1 black polish to use.  The shimmer polishes are clear-ish and you can just use the polish for a pastel shimmer or you can apply the black polish as a base and use the shimmer overtop.<br /><br />The gel scent or nail polish smell isn't overly strong but it is there.  The bottles are smaller then some sets but there is enough to do several full sets of nails / toes per bottle.  Polish is thick and applicator brush is okay.,B085SY4WC3,1605883977540,5.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Good size,"This is a nice nail light.  The width of the mouth is large enough to easily get your foot/hand in without scrapping the sides and ruining all the paint you just applied.  Digital screen is easy to read with bright lighting.  Heat/UV is normal and my set / dry times didn't vary by much.  The buttons are easy to press and it stores very well.  Overall, pretty good quality light haven't had any issues.",B08L6GXY2S,1604928678511,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,WOrks on thick hair,"I have long thick curly hair, these are able to clip into it without any trouble.  They are made from a light weight plastic/resin and the clips are your standard light weight thin metal.  Neither have broken and none of the mini ""twist"" hold clips have come off.  Overall, simple to use , look cool , and price well for adding a quick alternative to standard curly hair styles.",B08GC5GSNG,1602167637654,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,"Bottle 5 stars, Sprayer 1 Star","The bottles are great.  Nice amber color, good thickness and comfortable to hold.  Hold a reasonable amount and don't take up a ton of counter space.  The labels are even high quality, they have good adhesive and a decorative shape.  I like that they are not attached since some of us just dislike using them.  If I was just rating the bottle and accessory label I would give this 5 Stars.<br /><br />However, the Spay nozzle is trash.  It's decent plastic but to large for the bottle, the connector point between the sprayer and the bottle doesn't close properly so it leaks if this bottle is tilted and DO NOT turn the bottle over if spaying your hair upside down.  Then the nozzle turns , like rotates 360.  I don't know if it was designed to do that and if it was then okay, but it's still horrible.  One of my spray nozzles broke after 1 use, the pin on the inside of the handle must have let go because if you squeeze the trigger nothing happens it just pushes up and stays in place.<br /><br />Overall, I just couldn't give it more then 3 stars because of the issues.  However, if you just need or want the bottles then its a great deal.",B089CSF11Y,1598965713810,3.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Beautiful colors on the glitter,"I have tried 2 different sets of this bran, so far I like the quality of their products. You get 4 glitter polishes and one standard black polish with this set.  It does NOT include a base/top coat.<br /><br />You can use just as it is. The glitter does really pop when applied over the black or just as a glitter polish.  This brand offers some excellent coloring.  Often glitter polish has a full look, this is rather vibrant.  I did also apply the glitter polish over other brands of gel and had no issues.  You need a base coat if you are applying the black (or other color) gel polish on your natural nails, but if you are applying the gel polish on your acrylic or polygel nails you can skip the base coat.<br /><br />Overall this applies very easily, has standard set times using a UV/LED Light.  I got a little over 2 weeks right at 3 weeks before I had any chips or other issues.  For MY nails and daily activities that is a very long lasting gel.  I am normally happy with 1 to 2 weeks.<br /><br />Price point is very reasonable for what you get.",B086W18W1W,1598445407478,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Works great for parting/braiding hair,"I like this comb a lot.  I use it to get nice even parts while braiding the girls hair (one is 2, one is 22 and one is 30 lol) or for myself when wearing my hair up.  Nice quality, super easy to clean.  If you have thick / curly hair the comb works great for getting those tiny small knots out.  I would NOT try to pull this through a large amount of hair at one time.<br /><br />In general, this is a very nice quality comb and the tail works exactly as I needed/ wanted it to for nice even lines.",B088TYPM71,1597494092561,5.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Great for Sensitive skin,"My guy really seems to like this face scrub.  He works outdoors a lot with his job so sweat, dirt, grease, sun screen, etc is slapped on his face and in his beard daily.  He says he can feel the difference on his skin and in his beard after using this.  Really helps keep any blackheads or clogged pores from forming.  I enjoy the scent on him, it mixes well with his natural body chemistry.  In general for the price point its a really solid product.",B08BFH35VX,1597232637558,5.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Really surprised at how nice these are,Honestly I was expecting comical plastic brushes.  I received die cast heavy well made brushes!  The little bag for storage isn't the best quality but the brushes more then make up for the bags issues.  Each little wand has some noticeable weight to them.  The detailing is impressive and wraps around the entire brush handle.  The brushes themselves are somewhat small but that is useful when doing fine details.  More then likely these will just be on display more then used.  For the price point super amazing gift for any fan of fantasy.,B07YG4PRTN,1596726538788,5.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,I am not sure what this is,"This is a super thin argan oil  that doesn't feel like or even smell like any other argan oil I have ever used.  This is ultra runny and has a clear yellow color to it.  Honestly, it looks and somewhat smells like vegetable or canola oil.  My hands smell like fast food french fries.  I don't know what this is but I don't think its 100% Aegan oil at all.",B00O2FGBJS,1595769234982,1.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Not a bad face scrub,"This, for me, has been pretty soft on my skin.  The scent isn't the best, a bit medical/plain but doesn't smell bad at all.  The scrub itself is very soft, my skin didn't feel like it was left raw.  It felt smooth and clean after use.  No breakouts or rashes either.  I only needed a small, in-between dime/nickle size, amount to fully wash my fact and neck.<br /><br />Price point seems reasonable and overall it was nice.",B07MMW5654,1594916144403,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Easy to use,"I use these with my little foil wraps (both the home kind and store bought) and they work great.  Keeps everything in  place and allows me to move about without having to keep my fingers pointed up while I marinate my hands.  They clips are firm but not so strong that they cut off circulation to your finger tips or hurt.  My 95 year old grandmother used these with me and she is like tissue paper delicate.  She had no bruising or other issues.<br /><br />Overall, these work as advertised and aren't overly expensive.",B086VK22QT,1594128457865,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Not 100% pure aloe at all,"I don't like that this is advertised as being 100% aloe when it has additives to it like Phenoxyethanol & Xantham Gum just to list a few.  I get sometimes having to add preservatives but one of these is listed as a seriously harmful skin care product.<br /><br />Now, if you aren't worried about it.  Then Yes, this is a thicker gel like cream.  The scent is actually very nice and it goes on smoothly to your skin.  The absorption is rather quick and doesn't leave a sticky / tacky coating on your skin. Did not stain clothing and when it did get onto clothing washed out completely.<br /><br />Overall, comes down to what you are comfortable using for YOU which is why I gave it three stars.  It isn't for me but it may for others.",B08879N2W3,1593521829022,3.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Ultra soft,These are really cool / funky patterned headbands.  The material is that ultra soft t-shirt material.  Very light weight.  The elastic is firm but doesn't pinch your head or give you a headache when wearing over several hours.  Each headband was individually sealed/wrapped in plastic (you can see it in the photos).  The front of the band is pretty wide and the back is still about an 1 to  1 1/2 inches wide.  I have washed all of these twice so far and have had no shrinking or discoloration/ bleeding of the dyes.,B0885W8GCL,1592915894839,5.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Love the feel of my skin after using,"I like this a lot.  For me, this doesn't irritate my skin at all and my face is always super clean and soft after using.  No chemical scent or excessively floral smell.  no rashes, no breakouts and no dry skin.  Will put this on my buy again list.",B0914JBBTV,1588793012098,5.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Easy to apply and no skin irritations,"This is a pretty nice ampoule.  When looking at it in the bottle it appears a gel like substance, however, it isn't thick when using the eyedropper dispenser.  Goes on smoothly with no oily residue.  My skin did feel tacky for a few minutes while it absorbed.  There is a scent to this, it isn't citrus or fruity I just can't place it.  It's very mild and isn't unpleasant I just don't know how to describe it.  My face does feel soft after using but slightly dry as well.  I have had any irritations or breakouts while using.  Overall, it isn't bad at all and the price point is great.",B083TLNBJJ,1587213604858,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Does everything I expected,This is a pretty great set to give to someone just getting into styling their hair.  Each brush works well and is rather sturdy.  I have long thick curly hair and am able to use each one without them getting stuck in my hair.  Big big big props for that.  Easy to clean and price point is reasonable.,B082MDFNZM,1585684764217,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,No irritation and easy to apply,"I can't tell if I am seeing results or if my eyelashes are just happy to be makeup free for so long due to current issues with working from home.  This was easier to apply then I thought it would be, but I must admit I thought that it would apply like a mascara not a liquid eyeliner.  Hasn't irritated my eyes, hasn't caused any swelling or itching.  Overall, no scent, no bad side effects, price point is reasonable and I kinda sorta do see some results.",B07PCSRSND,1585425203547,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,"Mild menthol scent , very cooling","There is a mild menthol scent to this body wash.  What is nice about it, is that it doesn't smell medicated just refreshing.  Your body does get a cooling sensation which is perfect to use as an after workout cleansing soap.  The scent doesn't linger and this foams nicely when using.  Small amount goes a long way.  No skin irritations/breakouts when using.",B0844X21MJ,1585329736376,5.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Get a good amount for your money,"These are pretty great if you or whomever tend to lose hair clips a lot.  The colors, are pretty decent yet not quiet at bold as the advertisement shows.  They clip like standard hair clips, perfect for styling or using day to day.  None of the coating has come off and these do not take a ton of force to get them to clip, which is great if you are using on a child's hair.  Overall, for this price point you get your money's worth.",B07XVNJFNF,1585175006869,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Does assist in helping with sleep.,"I think it smells nice and it a great idea to calm kids.  At first, I  this was working great because our little ones were not waking up in the middle of the night.  But after about a week, that seemed to stopped.<br /><br /> I have found that using this a couple of times a week is giving us some better results..  Overall, any help is great help.,",B0713VF172,1583254523912,4.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Doesn’t streak,I am pretty much a pasty white girl that really needs to get out and see the sun way more often then I am able to.  So sunless tanners are my newest obsession.  I really enjoy that this 1 doesn’t smell like I am taking a funky chemical bath.  2 when I shower/ bath I don’t turn the water colors and while this does fade it doesn’t streak making me look like a melted crayon come to life.<br /><br />Note that if you use a sugar scrub or body wash you will have some variation in tinting on your skin.<br /><br />I had no rashes or breakouts and this is great for me since my current work schedule has me at work prior to the sun coming up and leaving after it sets.,B07SV4HTMC,1583080982079,5.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,slightly tacky feeling on skin after use,"This smells good, very much like spring break in Cancun or summers at the beach.  The lotion is very light weight almost liquid thin so it comes out pretty easily from the bottle.  It is absorbed rather quickly in the skin but for several minutes afterwards my skin felt like it was tacky.  After 5 to 10 minuets that went away.  Not a big issue when I am taking my time getting ready but not something I want to wait for when I am on a limited time window getting ready for work.<br /><br />Overall, smells good and does somewhat moisturize your skin but doesn't last throughout the day.",B07SW7D6ZR,1582036879842,3.0
AEOK4TQIKGO23SJKZ6PW4FETNNDA_1,Not for me but decent headbands,"These are cute and the material is soft on the various bands.  However, the plastic at the base of these bands sits just behind my ears and digs in over time.  So while I can wear these it isn’t for an overly long time.  Non of my bands had material that was messed up, the ones with pearls were attached well and large.",B0837K9W6P,1581281499853,4.0

AFGGRGHGHSFKMZASFBYFRHBBEOPA,Great for a temporary look,"[[VIDEOID:dba73b3e3fcbbfdf844ff14d4bf93e3d]] My tween loved these nails overall for a quick manicure makeover.  It only lasted a day.  She said she found the thumbnails annoying as they had more gems on them, which she though was a bit of overkill.  Fun and cute mani",B088M5P8FN,1596504240614,4.0
AFGGRGHGHSFKMZASFBYFRHBBEOPA,Sexy fragrance in a sexy bottle.,"I love the fragrance.  It has a woody/oaky scent to me and is very sexy.  I love that the scent not overly sweet,  a very mature perfume.  My husband loves it.  I am not very good at discerning notes.  This fragrance describes the top notes as bergamot, pear, black currant, pink pepper.  Heart/Middle notes are tuberose, muguet, jasmine sambac, and licorice.  Base notes are described as cocoa, vanilla and tonka.  I can slightly smell the vanilla and bergamot...the others I’m not so good at that.<br /><br />It has pretty good longevity and dries down to a ""warm"" fragrance.  Has decent sillage as well, only one spray will do.<br />Love this fragrance!  It just smells so good!",B0BTJ6SYKB,1595772886585,5.0
AFGGRGHGHSFKMZASFBYFRHBBEOPA,Lightweight moisturizer,I love using this cream on some dry patches I have on my arms.  I used to suffer from eczema and as I have gotten older it has since improved greatly but ever so often I get these random dry patches on my arms or face.  I love how this cream applies.  Feels like it absorbs well into my skin and my skin feels so soft afterwards.  It is not a thick cream and it very lightweight but that does not mean it has no moisturizing power!  I am very pleasantly surprised.  This is my first time using CICA cream and I am officially won over.,B0859CYSTM,1594671522792,5.0
AEKV4Q3JUQTQA2UR7PH7QLUHUTTQ,Good Oil...,I like it to use on my hair (just a couple of drops) keeps ends looking nice....and also my skin.  I use it in some of my natural skin products that I make...this is a good oil that does not cause any breakouts.  I do think in comparison to others this one is priced on the high side.,B08HDG9F44,1624120782710,4.0
AEKV4Q3JUQTQA2UR7PH7QLUHUTTQ,Nice combo!,"I didn't even know that Invisibobble made this combo hair scrunchie with the coil inside.  I think it is great.  Holds well and looks nice with the velour type fabric.  The only thing is this size might not work well for someone with really thick hair?  Not sure, but my hair is pretty fine and this only wrapped around it 3 times.  So for someone with thick hair it might not work?  This scrunchie really holds well...I wear it all day and overnight and it doesn't budge and feels very comfortable,  not too tight.",B08HXQ3T9K,1607634863144,5.0
AEKV4Q3JUQTQA2UR7PH7QLUHUTTQ,Nice set of bath bombs,"These are a good set of bath bombs....that do add oils and scent to my bath.  I like the selection of scents in this set and the fizz is pretty good.  I did take off one star due to size as these are on the small to medium in size and I have a very large tub, so I need to use 2 of these to get enough moisturizing product in my tub.",B089R7S73D,1598092067177,4.0
AEKV4Q3JUQTQA2UR7PH7QLUHUTTQ,A Rich Gourmand,"***Edited to add that this kept reminding me of something else I'd worn and now I'm thinking it is very similar to BBW Into the Night.***.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this scent....I like dark orientals and even though this is listed as floral gourmand, it fits the bill as a dark oriental for me.  I definitely get the base notes of vanilla, cocoa, tonka and benzoin....it is very reminiscent of a scent I used to wear a long time ago, but can't quite place it?  Maybe Euphoria?  Not sure, but this is a really nice rich dark scent that is heavier on the gourmand side than floral.  This is for sure a date night scent.",B0BTJ6SYKB,1596565300292,5.0
AEKV4Q3JUQTQA2UR7PH7QLUHUTTQ,This is a 2 part mask,"I was not crazy about the design of the actual mask.  It comes with a top portion and a bottom portion...which didn't stay in place on my face very well...and was just too much packaging for a face mask.  This is also different in that it is an actual cream, rather than the clear gel type or watery type mask.  I did like the cream ok, but I use these masks when I am bathing, and the 2 part design just does not stay in place properly and drove me crazy.",B08575Y9V3,1596197795234,2.0

AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Very small for $5,This soap felt drying to me. Very small and pricey for $5. This is the size of a golf ball it’s so tiny. Ingredients are okay but not moisturizing to me and did not have any scent.,B08KHRF9NY,1615930874057,2.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Nice and cold on the eyes,This is very refreshing and helps to wake me up during the day. The metal ball is nice and cold. There’s caffeine in it. No scent.,B0B8SFDJN9,1614200057478,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Great for traveling,This is a smaller brush that’s great for traveling. It’s lightweight and made of wood. The bristles are soft on my hair and don’t pull or tug. Runs through my matted hair easily.,B08JTNQFZY,1613785938145,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Smells like amazing delicious coconut but tastes sour and bitter,"This smells exactly like sweet coconut. Smells heavenly.

But it does work and removes dead skin but it’s almost impossible to avoid the gross taste because your rubbing it all over your lips.",B08RQZ3F3L,1612229686075,3.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Nice value size,This shampoo smells clean and nice. Helps my hair feel clean afterwards. The shampoo is a gel consistency and lathered fine for me. Easy to rinse and hair wasn’t greasy afterwards.,B087ZQG11L,1610152023431,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Not the greatest quality,The stamper already has holes in it and does not pick up paint well. The stamp is a clear rubber so once you pick up the polish it starts dispersing. The metal stamp plates are hard to clean as well. The dotted designs do not work at all. It comes out as a blob and the designs are not very clear. The scraper is a tiny bendable piece of plastic. Does not scrape all the paint evenly.,B08G4Y4SFV,1608694195491,2.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Fun glitter colors,The polish is very glittery and vibrant. Great for fun girls night in. The polish bottles don’t have the colors on top so you have to open each one to see what it is. I put a dab of polish on the top and cure it so it’s easier for me to see what polish it is.,B08CVCLVS2,1607736066583,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Labeled nicely and thick gels,Really like this gel set. They’re such beautiful colors and the glitter one is very stunning. Looks exactly as pictured.

AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Korean primer to minimize look of pores,"This is a Korean primer that helps with the look of your pores. Usually, when you put foundation over your nose or area where you have large pores, you can see them.<br /><br />With this, the pores are much smaller. The tube is a PUTTY to put over your pores area and it works well to smooth pits or areas that you have dented skin. The two serums are priming serums to even put the skins texture and help the makeup stick to your face. Dan onto the skin—don’t rub.<br /><br />Great for everyday wear. Set is on the smaller side but a little goes a long way.",B08F4ZDVZQ,1607307316628,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Not pigmented and stays wet,"For $20, these eyeshadow sticks are $5 a pop. I expected a better quality shadow but it’s not impressive to me. The shadow is very runny and there is no pigment once it blends in. It stays wet on my eyelid which I didn’t like at all. I was expecting a higher pigment from the advertised photos as well but it’s just glitter once it’s smoothed out.",B08DK5D9J5,1606163555618,2.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Nice quality nail clamps,These are perfect for holding down my fake nails while curing them in the UV light lamp. They’re sturdy and also curved to really hold them down.

AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Quality nail tips!,"These nail tips are really strong and have a thinner base so you can glue them on strongly.

AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Very moisturizing and larger hand wipes,These are very handy to have with their packaging. Each wipe is a moist wrap that you can wipe your hands or body with. My skin feels pretty moisturized and refreshed after this. Very happy with these!,B08DK4NDM3,1604713362862,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Smells like spices and cleans great,My dad is not a big fan of soaps but he loves this one. It smells like spices and is very nourishing on his skin. It cleans great as well. Suds up nicely and is easy to grip. Definitely recommend!,B0845LNDJK,1603244386404,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Perfect sized hand sanitizer,This is a nice gift for yourself or loved ones. It’s a nice sized bottle with a lot of product.

AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Love the jar and smells like jasmine,Like the size of this jar it comes with a lot of product. Smells like jasmine and it’s all natural ingredients. The paste goes on smooth and it’s very creamy and thick. Helped me stay fresh all day and hid my B.O. very happy with this product!! A little goes a long way. Half a pea size for each armpit was more than enough for me because the product melts into the skin.,B086MN4SRX,1599004091945,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Great quality set,The cape is comfortable and large enough to prevent any hair from falling on me. The case is faux leather and zips open easily. I’m really impressed with the scissors—they’re sharp and heavy. The combs are hard plastic. The clips are metal and durable (they won’t bend). And the cleaning cloth is velvet. Cut my hair beautifully. Very happy with this product. Built to last.,B088PYN4VM,1598923854700,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Reduces frizz and adds shine,"Absolutely love this shampoo. It doesn’t lather like other shampoos but it’s not suppose to. There’s a huge misconception that when a product is super soapy and there’s a lot of bubbles, it’s cleaning. That’s simply not true. You have to read the ingredients to see if those ingredients clean-which this shampoo does.<br /><br />Personally, this shampoo did a great job at cleaning my hair. It took 2 pumps for my hair that’s medium length. It’s a huge bottle that comes with a lot of product. The shampoo itself is thick and clear (no color added). I let my hair air dry and there’s was dramatically less frizz.<br /><br />I was shocked at the results. My hair is soft and shiny after three uses and I love how my hair looks and feels. I think it’s well worth $16 for the quality and quantity of shampoo you get. Very happy with this shampoo and would get again!!",B087ZQK2G8,1598552035484,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Love the convenient handle,This does a great job exfoliating the skin and it’s a great size. I don’t think it’s too hard or too soft. The fabric side is great to lather up soap. I just flip the elastic band over to use the other side. Convenient to use and great to throw away after it gets old. Very happy with this product!,B08B5FJMHM,1598399506308,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Extremely fragrant,"These bath bombs are beautifully packaged.

AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Not harsh and smells fresh!,"Got this for my boyfriend who’s not big into using facial products but now he is! He loves this scrub. The texture is thick, it’s a bit opaque and not harshly gritty. It’s a more finer grit and it felt nice on his skin.<br /><br />It smells fresh, like citrus almost but it’s not overpowering. His skin is definitely moisturized after using this and he’s added it to his daily routine. Definitely recommend!",B08BFH35VX,1597336488227,5.0
AHY2TURQPNIDXZGH2CMQLZ343YMQ,Very small,This pillow is a lot smaller than what I expected. Tried it out and the pillow only covers my head and lower neck area. I was hoping it would have more support but it’s pretty flat.<br /><br />It’s still a good pillow for a smaller tub though. It’s plastic mesh inside so it dries very easily. I think it’s comfortable inside the tub but the size runs smaller than expected.,B088ZVSLYP,1596680380895,3.0
AGN5KJZU3FYSKVWXWM66LXYWL5CQ,Great lengths,My wife loves this 4D Silk Fiber Mascara. She states this eyeliner adds beautiful length and incredible thickness to her shorter lashes.

AGN5KJZU3FYSKVWXWM66LXYWL5CQ,Not my favorite but it may be yours!,"I like one side of the loofah, but don't favor the other. The soft side feels great on my skin. It's smooth and doesn't bother me. The hand strap can be switched between sides so you can hold it on either side. I don't like the exfoliating side. Its too rough on my skin. It makes my skin sting even with the lightest touch. The loofah is also quite large for me to grip. I have a regular size hand and it can be hard to hold even with the band around my hand. The loofah holds a lot of water which makes it take awhile to dry even when I squeeze it at my hardest. Finally, the loofah isn't very flexible making it difficult to wrap around my body as I wash.",B08B5FJMHM,1601314273083,3.0

AGN5KJZU3FYSKVWXWM66LXYWL5CQ,Does not lengthen short lashes.,My wife was very pleased with the eyelash curler. However she was not happy with the mascara.

I love rubbing it into my grand daughters feet. She loves when it time for her nightly foot rub. She says it feels good on her feet and that it smells good. It does help relax her before bed. It works as intended! My hands feel a little weird after rubbing it in- not sticky but you tell there’s a layer on my palms.

AESCUI6VXJSHLUIO44Y5ERAHZE4A,Spreads easily,I like this aloe because it speaks easily and absorbs into the skin quickly. Its so hard to keep still letting it fully dry but this one doesn't take long at all. I like the lack for a strong scent and natural ingredients.,B08879N2W3,1595307562395,5.0

AFSHXT5PTGDSFW2725SDXIE6ZVEA,Lovely facial wash,This product comes out of the tube looking a bit like toothpaste.  After I spread it over my face I used a soft cloth and hot water to lather and scrub a little.  It worked well and my face felt fresh and clean after.  I was hoping it would have more of a lemon scent but it had practically no aroma at all.  Not that that's a bad thing.  This is a product I'll probably keep using even when the test period of finished.,B08TR1MKHD,1616860245072,4.0
AFSHXT5PTGDSFW2725SDXIE6ZVEA,So much nicer than I expected,"I'm pleased with this set of microfiber hair towels.  They are so much nicer than I expected at this price point.

That's just right.  The aroma is not like any other I've come across.  It's sweet, fruity, and chocolaty -  odd but enticing.  I've also been saving the packaging, putting a small damp tissue inside and slipping in a drawer or closet.  It lends an enticing scent.",B0B2L218H2,1605573040979,5.0

It has a pleasant, slightly fruity aroma – very nice.  My great aunt, the most natural beauty I’ve ever known, used apple cider vinegar on her hair.  She’d put a few drops in her atomizer with tea and used this potion for years and it served her well.

It comes with two viles of the eyeliner, application teasers and 10 pairs of lashes. I love the style of lashes because they're more natural and I can pull them off verses some others that have really thick dramatic ones that are so full, that they make me look ridiculous, these pairs have really thick bands though,  which isn't my favorite but again I shouldn't complain given the price. It also has a decent amount of magnets to get them to stick, they're easy to apply and remove. I love magnetic lashes oi very glue for sure.

AFO6QRJE7PPMBY2P66V2FPKJUIEA,Better than dealing with eyelash glue!,"This a fairly decent set of magnetic eyelashes. I will say I have tried a few different brands. The plus side about these is that they have several small magnets, making it easy to manipulate to your eye shape and have them fit correctly. Some brands only have 3 large magnets and the placing is hard to get a good fit. The second positive about these is that it comes with two bottles of the eyeliner which is awesome since you can keep reusing the eyelashes. I will say that these eyelashes are pretty long. I wouldn't say any of them are ""natural"" looking because of the length. I've toyed with cutting a pair to see if I like them better but am afraid I'll throw off the look...over all though I would say this is a good set.

They're stretchy and I haven't had any break which is awesome. I do think the price is a little steep, especially since some hair ties are really cute but others in my opinion are kinda corny and wouldnt be my first choice.

AGTGHYRTZXKX4AIL42A3FKWR7SOQ,"Painless and easy to use, but the device gets super hot","I have been using this hair removal device for 2 months now. I used it once every 2 weeks so I've used it 5 times so far. Now, the sessions will be only once a month until all the unwated hair is removed. The manufacturer recommends using it once every 2 weeks for the first 5 sessions and then once a month after that, so using it multiple times a week won't change the outcome. The areas I use this device are my legs, under arms, bikini area and upper lip. The only difference I've noticed so far is the upper lip hair. It is growing significantly less, like almost 90% is gone. The rest of the body hair still grows the same amount, but the hair started to grow softer. I assume the hair is finally becoming weaker. I am half Greek and half Italian, I have olive skin color with dark hair, so it might take over a year for me to see some results. Overall, the device is very easy to use and it is painless, but it gets super hot to the touch after about 5-10 minutes of continues usage. I use the device on my legs first and then take a break until it cools down, and then I continue using it on other parts of the body and stop to cool it down again. I have to admit it is frustrating to stop the session to cool down the device. I don't know if other hair removal devices get this hot.

After I dipped the cotton pads in nail polish remover, I wrapped them around my nails and put the nail clippers on for 15 minutes.

If you want something that removes make up quick and effectively then get this cleanser but don't expect your skin to feel soft and hydrated after using this.",B086VRRD99,1600484132826,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Purple does not look like purple,"So, I primarily got this because I liked the purple.  My daughter wanted a rainbow set so I figured it would work out well.  Best intentions....  She is happy with her rainbow - I do not like the purple.  It is more of a pink color....  does not look at all like purple!  And I only wanted the purple, so I'm disappointed.  BOO!<br /><br />The polish seems to last a decent amount of time.  The matte finish looks a little weird - sort of like a crayon exploded on her fingers.  But, she's happy so I guess that is fine.",B08W8LKLHB,1629756123602,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Great travel set,"I forgot to bring a moisturizer on my trip so I requested this.  I like the moisturizer. I find it a little heavy as I put it on but it actually absorbs very well.  The eye cream burned a bit and my skin actually felt drier - perhaps it is tightening the skin rather than providing moisturizer?  Everything but the mask has minimal to no scent.  Overall, I like this set but I cant imagine paying $60 for it.",B0949MJRHK,1624932770524,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Hate it :(,"My daughter has white blonde hair so I got this for her to share with her silver haired grandma during a trip.  She complained bitterly about it.  Said she could not wash it out, it made her hair blue and made her face greasy.  I thought it was tween drama ..... then I tried it.  Yuck.  While it smells GREAT without being perfumey  but it was like conditioning my hair with glue.  It made it super sticky and tangled.  And it stained the tub.<br /><br /> 2 stars because it smells nice",B08QKXY1KN,1624502485357,2.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Flattering colors,"The colors on this polish are really pretty and quite flattering.<br /><br />Its so annoying that the color of the polish isnt clearly indicated on the bottle.<br /><br />Other than that, this polish seems slightly runnier/thinner than others we've tried.  It is just a bit messier and 2 coats are definitely needed.  An led/uv light is definitely needed to cure the polish.",B08P15TB2V,1614399595468,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Gentle on skin not so much on hair,This brush is gentle on skin.  It isnt the gentlest on long silky hair.  The plastic feels a bit on the brittle and cheap side.  The self cleaning mechanism works well.  The tines are short and spaced close together and it tends to pull more on the topcoat than the undercoat.  I'd say this brush is better suited to larger dogs with shorter hair like a shepherd rather than dogs like my spaniels.,B08KY7VYDS,1611805020604,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Why???,"I was excited to get this because my girls are at an age where they like to play with hairstyles.  I tried using this on my youngest who has thinish straight hair and it basically 'crimped' her hair.  No curls.  Just flat straight lines where the iron ended and a slight wave in between each line.  Also, it only has 1 temp setting - high making it is easy to damage your hair.<br /><br />So, yes, this thing is small and you can tuck it into your suitcase but I'm not sure why anyone would bother since it is essentially useless.",B08NPBQR9L,1610660623324,2.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Not for me,These really didnt work well for me.  They pull on my eyelids rather than gliding gently.  Also they are too light and do not blend.  The pictures show deep colors and I was just not able to achieve those deep colors or blend the colors together.<br /><br />The formula is supposed to be waterproof and long lasting but these had worn off within hours.  I had a slight glitter effect left but that as it.<br /><br />Perhaps on someone with a different skin tone they would be better.,B08MPK4JRB,1607964973729,2.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Uncomfortable,"This mask bracket is super uncomfortable - its too hard on my nose.  On the bright side, it does help keep the mask off my skin and helps minimize my glasses fogging.  There is a slot to kind of 'hang' the mask on it but it doesnt work at all with my fabric masks.",B08FBHNBP1,1599530032451,2.0

Not drying though I did have to use a ton to get it to lather or even spread evenly through my hair.  I'd say my hair is marginally softer,  It is definitely NOT shinier.<br /><br />There is a mild unoffensive scent that does not linger.  Its clear so I dont think it has any added dyes etc.  I'd say this is better than most shampoos for those with naturally curly hair.",B087ZQK2G8,1598306750302,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,I like it but,"I like this hairdryer quite a bit but I feel like the company is trying to oversell it.  Promising to dry long thick hair in 10min is a little silly.  My daughter has a med amount of thin fine hair.  Her hair was mostly dry and it took 10min to finish it off.  That actually is longer than it normally takes.  it is also a little awkward to hold- it is just a bit top heavy.<br /><br />Why do I still like it?  It is on the quieter side for a 2000watt dryer.  It also left her hair very sleek and shiny.  In that sense, it worked better than any dryer I'e ever tried on her.",B082VYX7G8,1595382074254,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,LOVE the product Hate the packaging,"I LOVE the product but Hate the packaging.  First, there are no instructions in English on the container.  This means I have to come back to amazon, find the product page and look to make sure I got it right.  Also there are only 15 little pads in this large, heavy duty plastic container.  The pads are dry, some sort of resealable envelope would have worked just fine. I'd even be appeased if there were a refill package available.  But I don't see one.<br /><br />The pads are easy to use.  They do a phenomenal job cleaning - and I used it after taking a 3mi walk on a 90deg day with sunscreen on.  My face felt clean, soft and toned when I was done.  No residue, no slime, pores seemed smaller.  Amazing product.",B0851C4YPC,1594487401316,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Similar to other such products,"I find these lashes similar to other such products I've tried .... difficult to use.  I'm starting to think its me!  They are hard to apply correctly but I followed some advice to use 2 layers of liner - which makes them look less natural but they stay better.<br /><br />Given that I've left my house only a handful of times to go grocery shopping in the last 3mo due to Covid19, I cant comment on how long they last - only my initial impressions.  Hopefully someday I'll have somewhere to wear these again!",B086JN17SK,1593828345707,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Soft!,"I let my teen open the package and she said ""they're so SOFT!""  They are soft indeed.  The colors are wild IMO.  Depending on your fashion sense, they'll either match with everything or nothing.  ;)  But they are comfy to wear.  Very comfy.<br /><br />Some headbands advertise as being able to be used as masks/head coverings..... These will NOT work for that - they arent wide enough.  But as headbands, they're great.  Especially if you like bright bold patterns",B0885W8GCL,1592776888306,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Smells like a old fashioned dr's office,"I LOVE this stuff!  It smells like an old fashioned dr's office.  Clean, antiseptic.  The scent does not last so no worries if you're not as fond of that scent as I am.<br /><br />It goes on cleanly, and leaves no sticky residue.  It is a little thinner than most - more liquid than gel but that makes it easy to rub into my hands.  I seriously think its the best sanitizer I've used.  And I've used quite alot!<br /><br />I got it to put in my classroom, but I think I'll use the cheaper gel stuff there and keep this for my personal stash!",B087D7MVHB,1592170044350,5.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Matches my skin tone perfectly,I was a little surprised but this matches my skin tone perfectly.  It also provides a decent amount of coverage.<br /> It's a little thick on my skin - I think I'll like it better in the winter when my skin is drier -during the summer heat its a little heavy.  I do like the fact that it contains sunscreen which I sadly do not use often enough.<br /><br />I do really like it but it is a bit heavy.  I dont generally wear makeup on a daily basis so that will take time to get used to it.,B0855L611L,1592087643103,4.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Mediocre set,"This is a mediocre set.  It isnt especially bad nor good.  The scissor blades don't meet in the middle so they dont cut very well.  One set of nail clippers has a weird angle and leaves ridges on the surface of the nail.  The other does a better job but for some reason launches the pieces of nail far away - not great for keeping the house tidy.  The case doesnt stay shut.<br /><br />Overall, most of the pieces work they just dont do a great job.  I'd have preferred a simpler set with fewer pieces of better quality.",B083J1Y349,1587330293010,3.0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,These are ok,"Oddly enough, the scrunchies are not of uniform diameter.  The various colors fit differently.  One is too small for my hair and the other fits well.  I guess the too small one will go to my daughters.  The fabric looks cheap - especially on the  longer 'scarf' ones.<br /><br />The ones that fit work fine.  The elastics seem sturdy.

AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,OK not great,"Packaging says it's waterproof....it's not!

AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,Surprisingly good,"At the current price of $10 for the set, I honestly  wasnt expecting much.  Turns out this set is pretty good.  It fit fairly well in my hand though the handle could have been longer.  It did a nice job detangling my daughter's hair with a minimum of fuss.<br /><br />The set smelled strange on arrival and needed to be washed prior to usage.  -1 star for that",B082MDFNZM,1583300820864,4.0

I also needed to use a fair amount which is unusual for this type of oil.<br /><br />It smells nice and blends well but I did not find it moisturizing at all.  Strange?",B081632HX6,1578860908024,3.0
AGV5NQ4JDQD6NHXVF6AVZPVDX66Q,Perfect for My COVID Cleaning :-),"In these COVID times, we've had shortages of some basic cleaning and health items. I started reading some blogs about how to make some easy cleansers with natural products, like castile soap. Since then, I've been whipping up cleaning solutions like I'm trying to earn a Ph.D. in Potions from Hogwarts :-).<br /><br />These sprays are a good easy size to hold and carry without cramping or hurting hand with the weight of liquid. Not huge like some cleaning bottle sprayers. The nozzles can be turned from mist to stream and everything in between. The tube reaches to the bottom, so there is less waste. The bottles are clear so you can fill them and monitor them easily.<br /><br />These probably won't last a lifetime, but I'm happy with them. Better than reusing old chemical-laden bottles when trying to go greener.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",B08F79Z1Q5,1618622101752,5.0
AGV5NQ4JDQD6NHXVF6AVZPVDX66Q,"Wonderful to Use as a Shave Oil, No More Itchy Legs or Underarms :-)","I know this is a baby bath oil, but I'm a fan of using bath oils as shave oils.  A little goes a long way, just a few drops per leg (or you can add a drop to your regular shave gel). Helps reduce irritation and you can see where you are shaving! I can't live without it. It's better than any foam, gel or lotion on the market. Truly the best shave experience. I have thick hair and dry flaky skin that is prone to itching and sensitivity. I use this bath oil with a cheapie disposable razor and a few drops of body oil after a shower and my legs are silky for days. Literally days. No razor burn, no irritation, no frustration. I prefer unscented products and this is truly unscented--thank you! Please use caution when using oils in the tub, but I haven't had any problems with the tub getting slippery. Only thing I would change in a better bottle with a pump or dropper top. It's easy to use too much. A little goes a long way so if you're hesitant about the price, don't be, because you'll end up spending more in the long run on something cheaper.<br /><br />Also, used this as a body wash after getting a little too much sun today, and my skin was super soothed.  I think it will help prevent my skin from developing a sunburn--bonus! I may just have to buy a vat of this!<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",B07FP2C8N8,1594167960373,5.0
AGV5NQ4JDQD6NHXVF6AVZPVDX66Q,"Perfect Gentle Face Cleaning, and Ohhhh So Soft, too","The teo small round towels are incredibly soft and gentle, and it really did remove all my makeup with nothing but warm water and some gentle scrubbing. It's incredibly convenient and a great way to reduce waste and save money in the long run. Admittedly, it does take some time to get all makeup off but it's worth it in the end and it feels like a nice, warm facial massage. I actually add a few drops of facial wash to the towel and it removes all my makeup, even around my eyes. Good for my sensitive skin and great for the environment. The larger towel can be used to dry your face, or as a body/face towel.  I actually love the larger one for the shower.  Can use it on my face and body with just a few drops of castile soap.  Makes a gentle lather that pampers the skin. I wash all of these towels in a delicates bag with my normal bath towels and then hang to dry.  I know you aren't supposed to wash microfiber with cotton, but I throw caution to the wind and it's worked out fine.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",B088LWRYJC,1593726429555,5.0
AGV5NQ4JDQD6NHXVF6AVZPVDX66Q,Pretty Simple and Basic,"This was an okay aloe gel. Nothing really impressed me from this product. Same quality as any other aloe gel on the market.

I am going to use it longer to see if it makes a difference.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",B08879N2W3,1593144019440,4.0
AGV5NQ4JDQD6NHXVF6AVZPVDX66Q,Lovely healing product :-),"I actually find it to be very soothing for mosquito bites as well as sunburns. A wonderful pump makes it easy to apply.  I have sensitive skin and this is a lifesaver. I've tried other aloe and after-sun products that have a bunch of chemicals and are sticky! No this, it glides on so smooth, is clear, and is hydrating and cooling.  The pump works well. Not to mention free of chemicals and dyes. I use it when damp from the shower so it glides on easily and has time to dry before getting dressed.  Keep it in the fridge for extra cool applications!<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful.",B086VYKNDF,1592016516115,5.0

I used to never wear sunscreen but I finally decided to start wearing it daily and I wanted something that wouldn't rub off on clothes, cars, and furniture, so I found this and it is perfect. It never leaves my skin oily, it doesn't have white cast (white tint on skin) and is super light weight. It's like an aloe gel with sunscreen.  So far it hasn't hurt my eyes or skin, but it does have alcohol as an ingredient.  Very unique product which works great!<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",B084ZHP45Y,1584557939354,5.0
AGV5NQ4JDQD6NHXVF6AVZPVDX66Q,"Not 100% Agran Oil, OK for Hair Use, maybe not skin or face","This is no criticism of the distributor of this product, they do tell you the ingredients on the selling page:  Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Argania Spinoza, Kernel Oil(Argan Oil), Linum Usitatissimum (linseed) Extract, Parfum (Fragrance).  However, you expect this product to be mostly argan oil, and I don't think it is.  First, 100% argan oil usually has a very earthy scent.  This product is heavily perfumed.  And, if you're trying to reduce the 'cones in your hair styling or skin routine, you can clearly see that Dimethicone and Cyclomethicone are one of the first ingredients, before argan oil.<br /><br />I did use it on my hair after shampooing and conditioning.  I'm not a ""no-poo"" person, so I don't mind using this for my hair.  It did make my hair smooth and shiny with blow-drying.  However, there is a lot of fragrance in this product, which stayed with me and on my pillowcase for quite a while.  There is also a coating to my hair, unlike pure argan oil which usually sinks in my hair.  Some people like that coated feeling on their hair, but I only use those types of products on days where I'll be prone to frizzies.<br /><br />This product is just OK for me.  I would use caution using it on the skin because there is a lot of perfume and additives, so spot check first.  I'll just be using it for my hair.",B081632HX6,1578935820704,3.0

You can take out the dividers between the boxes to make larger areas.  The box makes it very gift-worthy as well.

AH36N5HJJQCBDAURJUTFAIB4GRFA,Zhaoyun Body Brush; Very Soft (Too Soft); Intended for Delicate Skin; Doesn't Exfoliate Well!,"I have delicate, acne-prone skin.  Lately, I noticed that the skin on my back was breaking out.  Fortunately, I began using the Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush.  It doesn't have sharp bristles that scratch and irritate my skin.  The brush feels as though it has plush fur from a plush animal.  It is very soft, almost too soft.  It feels great when I use it on the bottoms of my bare feet.  This brush, I believe is for elderly people or those with very sensitive skin.  It has a long, durable string for easy hanging in the bath or shower.<br /><br />Despite it not being very exfoliating, the skin on my lower back has cleared up quite a bit.  I've been using this brush faithfully for two weeks.  It is lightweight, manufactured well, and attractive.  I like the bamboo handle, which is smooth and easy to grip.  It doesn't put splinters into my fingers and palms.  I can use this brush all over my body, but I use it primarily on my back and feet.  It arrived inside its own plastic, transparent box for protection and for easy gift wrapping in case you want to give it to someone as a present.  The box can also be used for storing the brush.<br /><br />The brush's head is very easy to clean after it has been used.  I have used both bar soap and liquid soap on the head.  The brush works well with many types of soap.  When using this brush, I always feel as though I am treating myself to a luxurious bath.  I highly recommend this Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush to anyone who has delicate skin.  If you are looking for a type of brush that will exfoliate your skin (sloughing off all those dead skin cells), then you may want to look for another brush.  For right now, I am very satisfied with the Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush.",B08N9RT9YD,1612909424238,4.0
AH36N5HJJQCBDAURJUTFAIB4GRFA,MBA Night Renewing Serum Helps Reduce the Appearance of Wrinkles Around My Eyes!,"No, I'm not vain, but I don't won't to look old before my time.  I'm a fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male who just retired after 34 years of government service.  Fortunately, I still look as though I am in my forties.  What is my secret?  Simple.  I don't smoke, I don't lay out in the sun, I drink plenty of water, and I moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  Lately, I've also learned the importance of using products, such as facial serums, that have retinol, which reduces wrinkles around the eyes.  I don't believe in plastic surgery but I do strongly believe in using topical products that reduce the appearance of aging.  Everyone I personally know who has had plastic surgery ended up looking like a clown with a lopsided mouth and huge, shocked eyes.<br /><br />  I've been using several Higher Education products as part of a facial cleansing and healing regimen.  The products that I've been using are the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser and the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème.  Both are excellent products; I am quite pleased with them.  Thanks to them, my skin looks healthy and glowing.  After I retired, I moved from Virginia to Tennessee and the change in environment caused my face to become badly dehydrated.  I was waking up with dry, irritated patches of skin on my face that sometimes stung.  Thankfully, with the help of the Higher Education products, I have been able to heal my skin and keep the dry patches away.<br /><br />  I also decided to use the MBA Night Renewing Serum from Higher Education as part of my nightly ritual.  The MBA is to be used only at night.  Also, the consumer is to use it only twice a week and gradually increase its usage as tolerated.  Well, I've been using it every night for two weeks without any issues.  However, I use it sparingly around my eyes.  I've noticed a difference in the three weeks that I have been using it.  Fewer wrinkles and smoother skin.  The serum is light-green and doesn't have a distinguishable scent.  It burns slightly when I put it on but the burning sensation quickly goes away.  I use the MBA after applying my GOAL DIGGER, which moisturizes my skin, preparing it for the MBA.  Like I stated earlier, I've been using the MBA for three weeks and I haven't experienced any ill side effects or allergic reactions such as acne, hives, blisters, or red, swollen skin.<br /><br />  The serum arrived in a 1.7 fluid-ounce pump bottle with a plastic, transparent cap.  For some unknown reason, I keep forgetting that the tube has a pump.  I want to squeeze the tube as though it were toothpaste.  The cap prevents accidental leakage and spillage.  I think it would be difficult to tamper with the tube.  The tube arrived inside a sturdy, cardboard box, which contained company literature.  The MBA is a good product.  My only issue with it is the expiration date.  An expiration date is provided on the back of the tube's crimp and on the bottom of the box.  It reads as follows:  EXP 09/20.  This is not a good date, especially for a product that will probably be in usage for three to four months, if used sparingly.  I expected it have about the same expiration date as the one I found for the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser and the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème, which is 09/21.<br /><br />  I wonder if Higher Education decided that giving products that would soon expire to reviewers from the Amazon Vine Program was a good means for disposing of aging products.  Whenever I review a food or hygiene product, I always look for an expiration date.  Not all hygiene products have expiration dates.  I think they all should in order to let consumers know whether or not they are receiving safe products with fresh ingredients.  I hope that customers who actually purchase the MBA Night Renewing Serum will obtain a product with a better expiration date.  Nevertheless, I believe that MBA is good for lessening the appearance of wrinkles.  MBA won't remove them completely.  I don't think anything will.  However, MBA will help to minimize them.",B07MN1KJ15,1596766801814,4.0
AH36N5HJJQCBDAURJUTFAIB4GRFA,This Green Vegetable Crème from Higher Education Makes the Perfect Facial Moisturizer!,"I never realized how important, powerful, and essential green vegetable are for maintaining good health until I used the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème from Higher Education.  I am using this product along with two others that are manufactured by Higher Education:  NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser and MBA Night Renewing Serum.  I always use the NO BRAINER prior to using the GOAL DIGGER.  The GOAL DIGGER feels luxuriously soft, soothing, and relaxing as I apply it to my skin.  I use it at least twice a day, in the morning and at night before I retire to bed.  Sometimes, I use it more often, applying it to problem areas of my skin:  beneath my eyes, around the corners of my nose, and around the corners of my mouth.  This cucumber crème is safe to use often because it is made from vegetables that hydrate your skin.  I often saw women putting cucumber slices on their eyes to reduce puffiness.  Now I know that it must work.<br /><br />  When I retired and moved from Virginia to Tennessee, my skin had a difficult time adjusting to the new climate.  Many mornings I woke up with dry patches of red, irritated skin throughout the sensitive triangle of my face where my eyes, nose, and mouth are.  It took about a month of diligently using an expensive high-end moisturizer three and four times a day before the dry, irritated patches of skin went away.  Thanks to the faithful usage of the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème, the dry patches have not returned.  The No Brainer gently cleans my face, leaving it moist and supple, not dry.  Then I apply a liberal amount of the Goal Digger.  At night, I also use the MBA Renewing Serum with 0.5% Retinol around my eyes in order to prevent wrinkles.  I am able to use the MBA every night without it aggravating my skin.  I've noticed a difference since I've been using this product.  All three Higher Education products (the NO BRAINER, the GOAL DIGGER, and the MBA) have worked very well for me.  I highly recommend that they be used together in order to maintain healthy, attractive skin.  I am a fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male.  Friends and relatives tell me that I look much younger than fifty-six.  Many believe that I am still in my forties.<br /><br />  The GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème can be found in a large, flat jar made of very hard plastic that is blue.  It has an easy-to-remove screw-off/screw-on lid.  When I first opened the jar, I found a hard cardboard, tabbed protective seal beneath the cap.  This seal prevented accidental spillage and leakage during shipping and also served as a deterrent against harmful tampering.  An expiration date is provided on the bottom of the sturdy, cardboard box in which the jar was packed and it is also faintly stamped on the bottom of the jar itself.  The expiration date is as follows:  EXP: 09/21.  This is the same expiration date that was also on the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser.  The two products are meant to be used together.  09/21 is a good date.  Both products will be long gone before then.<br /><br />  If you are searching for a moisturizer that will prevent dry, irritated patches of skin from appearing overnight on your face, then I highly recommend that you use the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème from Higher Education.  I've been using it for three weeks and have not experienced any ill side effects such as acne, hives, blisters, etc.  I seriously doubt that you will since it is made primarily of vegetables.  Our moms always said vegetables were good for us.  Whenever I use the GOAL DIGGER, I feel that I am playing with my green vegetables.  Using it is fun.",B07ZS3DKL5,1596759782871,5.0
AH36N5HJJQCBDAURJUTFAIB4GRFA,Higher Education NO BRAINER Effectively and Thoroughly Cleanses My Face without Drying It Out!,"Eight months ago, I retired and moved from Virginia to Tennessee.  The change in environment, I believe, is what contributed to my complexion becoming extremely dry.  In the mornings, I began waking up with red, flaking, irritated, inflamed patches of skin beneath my eyes, at the corners of my nose, and at the sides of my mouth.  After a month of using a very expensive moisturizer four times a day, the patches of damaged skin were eventually healed.  I feared that the patches would reappear after I finished using the high-end moisturizer.  Thankfully, I received the opportunity to review three facial hygiene products from Higher Education:  NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser, GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème, and MBA Night Renewing Serum.  These are strange names for three products that have worked wonderfully.  I have faithfully used them all every day for three weeks.<br /><br />  Let me say that I am a fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male with a raunchy complexion.  I still get pimples occasionally.  My skin can tend to be oily but if I wash it too much it becomes very dry.  The NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser is one of the few cleansers that actually cleans my face without drying out my skin.  After I use it, my skin still feels soft and supple.  In the mornings, I wash my face with the NO BRAINER before I shave.  Then I take a shower.  Even after I step out of the shower, my face still feels soft and supple, not like a piece of dry leather.  The cleanser tends to add moisture rather than take it away.  Also, I can use it twice a day without worrying about it drying out my skin.  When I first moved to Tennessee, my face became so dry that I could only wash it in the mornings and I could only shave every other day.  Now I am back to washing my face twice a day and shaving every day.  I feel cleaner and more ready to face the world when I am clean shaven every day.  Also, I wake up the next morning with fewer pimples if I am able to wash my face before going to bed.<br /><br />  The green gooey substance in the tube is easy to apply to my face and easy to wash off.  It feels luxuriously pleasant on my face.  The cleanser has a faint, pleasant scent that is neither masculine or feminine.  Neither does it linger after I have used it.  The six fluid-ounce tube was received inside a sturdy cardboard box with company literature inside.  A tabbed piece of gray metallic tin foil covered the tube's nozzle.  This foil was intended to prevent accidental leakage and spillage during shipping and to also serve as a deterrent in case someone wanted to contaminate its contents.  There is an expiration date on the bottom of the box and one on the back of the tube's crimp:  EXP:09/21.  This is an excellent date.  This cleanser should be used up long before then.<br /><br />  Most importantly, I have been using this superb hygiene product for at least three weeks and haven't experienced any allergic reactions such as acne, boils, hives, rashes, etc.  I am very happy with it.  If you are searching for a facial cleanser that is soothing, gentle, and hydrating (it won't dry out your skin), then I highly recommend the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser from Higher Education.",B07ZQRX7FX,1596747088508,5.0
AH36N5HJJQCBDAURJUTFAIB4GRFA,Biore Safely and Efficiently Removes Makeup from My 82-Year-Old Mom's Face!,"My mom turned 82 in March.  She is extremely active for her age.  Before the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020, she would go grocery shopping once a week.  During the pandemic, she went as often as three times in one week.  She was always concerned about us not having enough to eat.  Mom, who is vain, also wears a lot of makeup to conceal her true age.  Therefore, she was excited to obtain the 7.8 fluid ounce bottle of Biore' Makeup Remover.  It is a clear oil with a very pleasant scent.  Mom has been using it for two weeks.  She told me that a little goes a very long way.  She gently rubs the oil on her fingertips and then rubs her fingertips all over her face.  Using a Kleenex, she carefully rubs off the makeup and Biore.  She does not like splashing water on her face for fear of splashing water, makeup, and Biore all over the bathroom sink.  She is very OCD about keeping her bathroom and entire house clean.<br /><br />  The Biore efficiently and safely removes Mom's thickly layered makeup.  She hasn't experienced any ill side effects or allergic reactions from using the Biore.  Her skin is oily like mine.  We don't wrinkle easily.  Both of us look very young for our ages.  Also, I would like to point out that the plastic bottle of Biore arrived with a protector around the nozzle and pump, which is very nice.  The hard plastic protector is transparent.  It easily slips on and off the pump, making it highly reusable.  It protected the Biore against tampering and accidental spillage during shipping.  (The protector covers the nozzle's opening and prevents the pump from operating.)  I highly recommend not throwing the protector away; you may want to do some travelling and take this attractive pink bottle of Biore with you.  My mom and I both recommend the Biore Makeup Remover for removing the thickest layers of makeup.",B0914JBBTV,1587561145301,5.0

Yesterday, after a couple hours of gardening in the hot sun, I used one sturdy wipe (they're about 8""X5"") on my face, neck, chest, arms, and hands, as a very refreshing clean-up.<br /><br />These are nothing but essential oil and water, no chemicals, so your skin won't be dried out or irritated.

Add soap to the bristles and get really clean.<br /><br />This set would make a nice gift.

AEXO6YBJHQZFPLVRQJI6VX7IJDNA,Bar of Soap with Calendula Oil,"It's got to be the Calendula oil that leaves your skin so moisturized after using this soap.

I think you'll be very happy with how it leaves your skin feeling most of all.  It's advertised as being all natural as well so if you have sensitive skin, you shouldn't have any problems with this although I'd always recommend trying a test patch first before using it in the shower all over.",B08KHRF9NY,1615845588672,5.0

AEXO6YBJHQZFPLVRQJI6VX7IJDNA,Dried Flower Buds,"I want to explain why I didn't give this neat product a better rating.  First let me say that I do like the idea - i love it in fact.  I was so excited about receiving this product because it was so different and unique.  I wanted to learn how to use this product in different ways.  When I received it, I got the bag as pictured above and couldn't figure out what was inside.  There was no description on the outside at all.  I didn't know what was inside till I ripped the bag open. After I opened it, I immediately saw the beautifully colored foil wrapped buds and remembered ""Oh yes, this is the flower buds that I saw that can be used as tea, bath pods and for baking.""  There was no description, instructions or anything inside other than the beautifully foil wrapped buds.  I'm still left wondering how I will use them.  If I use for tea, I suppose I just wing it and drink the tea when I think it's done as there's no recipe for how long to steep to experience the perfect amount of flavor is extracted.  If I use for a bath, I'm sure there would be much more flexibility but it also advertises you can use for baking.  I have no idea how to use it for that.  If I wanted to use it for a gift, it would be incomplete not to mention that in order to even know what I ordered, I had to already open the pretty bag so that would ruin the presentation.  I feel this is a great product with great potential to be a high end gift or luxury indulgence.  They just have one more step to complete in the way of instructions and explanation on the packaging to make it achieve it's potential.  This idea could easily go viral and become very popular.",B08KT7FCYY,1609859041126,3.0

I'm not sure how long it would take to make my cellulite become less visible but I will keep using it for the mere purpose that it does feel good.  I would say too that it would make a good gift because it's so unique.  I do recommend this product and for the price it's a good value for either a gift or keeping it for yourself as a treat.

They are also cute and sparkly so that is a bonus.  You don't get any instructions but there is always the internet.  I found the brush bristles to be a little longer than a normal paint brush length so they were harder to use until I got used to them.  I bet that length is handier for nails.  I like these overall.

With a consistency similar to a new bottle of luxury brand traditional polish they are a dream to apply. You get total coverage in two coats and they cure beautifully.<br /><br />The colors are ridiculously bright and I have no idea what I’m going to use them for, but right now it just makes me smile to look at my swatches and that’s good enough for me!",B08W8LKLHB,1624248392072,5.0

After placing the face mask (which fits me well) I use the extra serum on my neck, décolleté, and hands. I usually read or watch something on my tablet while I’m wearing it which means I have my glasses on. I am so pleased that they sit well on my nose and don’t interfere with the action of the mask in any way. It has never irritated my sensitive skin, and has proven soothing when my skin is having a reaction to something else.<br /><br />These are also remarkably affordable (when I ordered them) for what you get which means I can use them regularly rather than save them for emergencies and special occasions!<br /><br />10/10 Would recommend!",B08XZDXTG2,1621715663478,5.0

It doesn’t provide “intensive plumping” or”improve skin elasticity” which are just ridiculous claims, particularly when you consider this used for one week and the first two ingredients are water and glycerine. I have pure glycerine and  after mixing it with water in various percentages, I’d be comfortable betting that this product is at least 70% water.<br /><br />I was able to cleanly snap all seven ampoules using the plastic topper provided. Even though my snaps were clean the edges of both pieces are sharp and you shouldn’t touch them. It took me several tries to figure out how to get all the serum out of the ampoules. For three days I was tapping the opening on my palm which didn’t feel great, but I just couldn’t get it to pour out cleanly.<br /><br />Although it is almost as liquid as water, if you get the opening of the ampoules covered with the liquid it won’t come out because of surface tension. If this happens just turn the bottle open side up and blow on the liquid until the opening is clear and you’re good to go.<br /><br />If you can tilt the bottle just right you can get the serum to pour out. It’s tricky, but spend the time doing it that way and you’ll save yourself a lot of frustration. You see me getting it right in the video, but even then I had to blow the ampoule open once.<br /><br />There is also the cost. $50.00 for one week of use. That’s about $200 a month and $1250 a year although it does specify that you should use this daily for six weeks, maximum. Why? Is that concerning to anyone else?

AHG5KKQMMZJA46LDH73IZ4QUHYXA,Thickened but dried out my beard.,"I would give it 2 stars but I actually like the (opposite) effect it had on my beard. It ended up drying out my beard but gave it a fuller effect. The conditioner itself is a thick lotion like consistency, very hard to squeeze out. Scent is a light spearmint that doesn't transfer to my beard well. Disappears after rinsing. End effect left my beard and face feeling dry and chapped, not what I want from a conditioner.",B085J354CL,1599894700452,3.0
AHG5KKQMMZJA46LDH73IZ4QUHYXA,Amazing scent. Brings out the color in my skin.,"First, the scent is AMAZING...Sweet blood orange with a grapefruit bubble gum undertone, maybe even some jasmine and peppermint, something that awakens your olfactory. Its very strong but not overpowering. Truly one of the best things I've smelt.<br /><br />APPLICATION: Goes on fairly oily and blends pretty well. Immediately brings color to my face, I have medium skin and it starts with an apricot redness but fades back to an awakened tone. I really enjoy that about this, I see others complain about this so maybe it's not best for fair skinned people?.<br /><br />Once dry, I am left with a matte sheen that is well hydrated. You expect it to feel oily but it's more like a raw feel. A really nice balance of hydrated but not wet and definitely softer. I really enjoy this product as well as their others I've tried and will happily continue to use this as my nightly regiment.",B08BZ1RHPS,1598084062304,5.0
AESIZ3ATHVPMZM5NI6ZJOZBH547A,Really nice,"I am ridiculously picky about moisturizers. This is definitely up there as a favorite. As far as ingredients, it's not top notch but its not awful. I don't love the addition of dimethicone, especially so high up on the list. Nothing is organic so that's another demerit. I do love how high squalane is so there's pros and cons. My skin is very happy with this so I'm going to stop analyzing the ingredients too closely. It doesn't pill and really seems to sink deep into my skin. Isn't greasy or heavy. Works well under makeup and feel light yet hydrating. The fragrance is light, nothing flowery or offensive. I also like that the big super size jar isn't that bright blue, it's a pretty pearlescent white. This big tub will last awhile but I would definitely get it again.<br /><br />Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Squalane, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Lactose, Lactis Proteinum/Milk Protein/Protéine du lait, Yogurt Extract, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Cichorium Intybus (Chicory) Root Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Olus/Vegetable Oil/Huile végétale, Camelina Sativa Seed Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Lens Esculenta (Lentil) Fruit Extract, Sodium Lactate, Sodium PCA, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Pentylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Juniperus Mexicana Oil, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Sorbic Acid, Phenethyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum/Fragrance, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal",B08WF29DM9,1615902129462,5.0

This Murad cream is more dense than I expected, but not in a bad way. Goes on smoothly and keeps my skin feeling hydrated. A little bit does a great job so this will last a while. My only hang up with some Murad products is the fragrance they use sometimes. Thankfully there is no added fragrance in this cream so I'm very happy.

AESIZ3ATHVPMZM5NI6ZJOZBH547A,So many options!,"I've never tried this brand before so I was curious to get to testing. Before using on my nails, I did some testers to see the outcome. The confetti ones I did on a white gel color base, one of the glittery ones I did on black. I love the grey with the subtle glitter in it. Everything applied smoothly with no lumps, except for one (not pictured in the testers, but the top left in the company's photos). That one was a bit odd but maybe for someone with more finesse and skill. This set comes with base, top and matte top coat. The glittery ones have good pigment to them, you don't need any color base to make them pop. In my photo, I only did one coat. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. I do my own and some friends' nails on a regular basis. They're super excited to do the green for St Patrick's day and the confetti ones for Easter.

I'm not an eye rubber so I was bummed to see how much it faded.

AESIZ3ATHVPMZM5NI6ZJOZBH547A,A nice set to use before makeup application,"l really like this set! The size is perfect to try something new without buying them individually and obviously, they're great for travel. The entire set is meant to be used together before makeup application for a good base. I like them all but particularly enjoyed the prime essence and priming water. They both feel very light, sometimes I use them without the primer. As for the primer in particular, it's heavy on dimethicone which is something I usually try to avoid in my primers. While it leaves a silky feeling, I just am not a fan. I think it's just a cheap filler that a lot of products rely heavily on. I feel like my skin can't breathe when there's silicone primers on it. But that is just personal preference. I will use it on occasion when doing a full face. Overall I think this is a nice set so I'm happy I tried it.",B08F4ZDVZQ,1606176617994,4.0
AESIZ3ATHVPMZM5NI6ZJOZBH547A,Deep and sexy,"I really like the idea of these scent wipes, you can throw one in your bag for on the go fragrance. I never understand when people carry around an entire bottle of perfume, seems too heavy and what if your expensive scent leaks? These are the perfect solution. After opening, I left it and reused it again the next day. Put a few drops of water on it cause it had dried and dabbed on my wrist. Still smells delicious.<br /><br /> I'm a total perfume junkie and I really like Gilded Fox. It reminds me a bit of Elizabeth and James Nirvana Black. It has a deep, sexy scent with notes of amber and vanilla-y caramel. Warm and alluring for sure. Not really a floral for me, which is great because I don't like flowery smells. I don't mind some hints of jasmine or rose but overall I like warm, woodsy scents. I'd definitely check out some of their other offerings.",B0B2L218H2,1605705645693,5.0

My hair is just a bit beyond shoulder length so I got some hair left out at the bottom that looked nuts after I removed these. They coil up into itself in a roll, so you don't really get a falling curl. More like a jacked up Annie. The silicone at the top and the bottom ripped out my hair when I was trying to remove them. They're too time consuming for me, I'd rather use my curling iron and get the curl I'm expecting vs. these which may leave you with some nutty looking curls.",B08BLKFGND,1600729040686,2.0

I'm on a forever quest for my perfect red - my number one favorite so far is cruella by nars. This is a tight second! It's a much different shade then cruella, so it brings a totally different vibe. It's a beautiful true red falling slightly warmer than cool toned. The formula is amazing. I like that it has a matte finish but it's not a matte that sucks the life and moisture out of your lips. It feels very comfortable, not like a heavy lipstick. You can easily get an undone faded look, like you're not trying too hard(compared to going all out with lip liner etc). I love the way it wears too, it doesn't just disappear in certain spots. Great staying power overall. I'd rank this with more expensive beauty brands, it's an amazing formula.

I don't love those because of the glue and thickness of them and this is the perfect solution to get length without the thickness. Polygel is easy to work with because it doesn't harden until you cure it, so you can make sure it's just how you like it. It's easy to use the dual forms included with the set. Comes with some cute colors, base and top coat a few nail art things to experiment with and the little uv light. The gel polish colors have great opacity with 2 coats. Really, this is just about everything you need(just grab some rubbing alcohol and acetone) to give it a shot! And, super bonus of the carrying case to organize!

These are really comfortable, not too tight. They don't slip off either which is great.  You can double it to make it a thinner band. Cute patterns and super soft material that isn't too heavy.

AEQKG4FNUB67X4JUBJRWT3ISVKDQ,Cute Headbands and great value,"This was an ok set of headbands for the money and at a good value. The set came with 10 hairbands, which equaled out to be cheaper than buying them individually. I got them to split up as gifts between my daughter and my nieces.<br /><br />My daughter and I love all of the colors and think the knot style is really cute, but I feel that the quality is not the same for all of the headbands. Some are perfect, but some are not. The knots were not in the same spots on all of them. Some had knots on the top in the middle and then some of the knots were slightly off to the side. Also the fabric on some are glued on slightly crooked and some are a smaller size then the others.  So a couple of them were too small for my daughters head. Even though some have a few minor issues, she says she still loves the ones I gave her. So I am at least happy about that. She does wear them all the time and they do look flattering on her. The only thing is the flower print ones she has a harder time matching to her outfits, so she usually wears those ones with a solid color shirt. My nieces are also happy with theirs. The ones that were actually too small for my daughter were the ones that I gifted to my nieces, which turned out great because they fit both of my nieces good. <br /><br />Overall I am ok with this set. They were a great money saver and great for gifting. The hairbands are cute and little girls love them. Even with the few minor flaws I would still get them again.",B089QR2Y5B,1610459097912,4.0
AEQKG4FNUB67X4JUBJRWT3ISVKDQ,Great LED/UV Lamp,"This is a nice nail lamp and it works great. My ten year old daughter and I are recently new to doing nails with Gel polish. We really enjoy practicing doing each others nails. However, the first LED/ UV lamp that we got would get too hot for my daughter to be able to stand on her hands. So I decided to look for a different lamp. I had seen many of the reviews on this lamp that had said it was great to use with children. Plus it had mentioned that it included some accessories. Which made it a great value for the money. So I decided to give it a try. Now we have had it for a little over two months and it has been great. We use it quite often and it's pretty simple to use. You just put your hand inside, and it turns on right away or you can select one of the timed buttons. It cures all gel polishes quickly. My daughter has also been just fine using it. It hasn't gotten too hot for her at all, even when it's been on for a while. It also included some extras. It came with some profesional quality files, a cuticle trimmer, a brush, and a really awesome scraper tool that works so good at scraping the gel polish off.<br />          Furthermore, we are definitely happy with this lamp, and I don't think we will ever go back to regular nail polish that you have to wait for them to air dry.  I also plan on buying another one so that my daughter and I don't have to share just the one.",B085ZRVDKP,1603166022928,5.0
AEQKG4FNUB67X4JUBJRWT3ISVKDQ,Great Rubber Bands at a Great Deal,"These are awesome rubber bands and they are such a great deal for the money because you get alot of them. Altogether I got 1000 colorful ones and 1000 blacks ones. I got them for my 10 year old daughter and she loves them. They are more gently on the hair than most kinds , so they don't hurt as much to pull them out if we don't have scissors handy. They are also pretty durable. I seen other reviews saying that they break easily, but I literally tried to break one on purpose to see how far I could stretch it and it took alot to break it. Also, with the few that I stretched out, I thought that they would stay stretched out and that I would of had to throw them out. However,  after I let each rubber band go, it actually snapped back to the original shape and size. Another positive is that since there are so many , I was able to fill up two snack size ziplock bags (one colorful & one black) for my daughter to have to play with her dolls and make her rubber band bracelets. She still has plenty left to last a while for her hair. The next time we need to get more, these will be the only kind that I buy.",B089KBMST6,1602341559293,5.0
AEQKG4FNUB67X4JUBJRWT3ISVKDQ,"Nice, But Time Consuming","   These are nice curlers and they are just as described, but I would say they are more suitable for teens and adults who tend to be more patient.<br />       My 10 year old daughter wanted to try them because she wanted curls without having to use a curling iron. She has somewhat thick hair so I got her two different sets with multiple size curlers so that we would definitely have enough and have the right size. Neither set included any instructions, but it's common sense to know that the hair needed to be wet prior and it was easy enough to figure out how to apply the curlers. However, neither of us realized how time consuming the whole process would be. Half way through applying the curlers, my daughter started to get antsy and didn't want to sit there anymore. She also said that it hurt a little when pulling the hair through some of the curlers. We managed to finish getting the curlers in her hair, but by the time we were finally done she was just over it all. She was no longer willing to even wait for her hair to dry. So within about 10 minute she had starting pulling all of the curlers back out. Which that was another process. You have to be careful pulling each one out because if you start doing it too fast the hair will get tangled and stuck in the curler.<br />      I still think these curlers are nice though and I do think they would have looked great if she would have waited long enough, but they just weren't for her. I would recommend them for someone who doesn't mind being patient for the end result. For my daughter though we learned that it's just better to use a more quicker / instant method to curl her hair.",B087FTZSZH,1601841599081,4.0
AEQKG4FNUB67X4JUBJRWT3ISVKDQ,Great Hair Cutting Set,"This is a great set for the money.  I got it because I am a hair dresser and I can never have too many hair cutting tools. I also love testing out different hair cutting shears.<br />It comes with everything thing you would need to complete a hair cut.  It's perfect for beginners, while also being good enough for professional use too.<br />Here are the pieces that I received in my set: Hair Cutting Shears, Thinning Shears, A tool for adjusting the tension screws on the shears, a cleaning cloth, two hair dressing combs, a razor comb, black cape,  a sweeping brush, two hair clips, and storage case for the shears and combs. After using this set about 5 or 6 times now, I can say I am pretty happy with it and everything is just as I expected. For the hair cutting shears and thinning shears, they are both decent quality, sharp, and cut well. I love the hair clips too. They hold well and stay put in the hair. I definitely plan on getting some more of those. For the razor comb, I haven't really used that yet, but it looks to be ok quality. When I do get a chance to use it, I will update my review if anything ends up being wrong with it. For the rest of the set, they are pretty much standard quality and as expected.  Overall, I am happy with this set and I have nothing negative to say about it.",B088X2WPTX,1601569129830,5.0

They are comfortable to wear and don't hurt at all. Within 3-5 minutes the nail polish comes right off. It makes the process much easier and quicker.

It is definitely great for beginners .<br />  It is just as described and as pictured. It works great, it's not loud, it doesn't shake, and it doesn't get hot.

AG5A4BNLSYHH2IEFJD3UM3N2IPMA,"Good, but there is better out there","First of all, this stuff smells amazing! like a fresh pot of coffee!<br /><br />Second, however, it's not much more than coffee grounds... I could pretty much duplicate this scrub from stuff in my kitchen for a lot less money. It's coffee grounds, olive oil, salt and sugar, basically. There are a few other little active oils which I happen to also have around as I make my own soap, so the vitamin E oil, ect, is already in my cupboard as well.<br /><br />The big question though... is it WORTH duplicating (or purchasing again)?<br />The answer for me is, unfortunately, no. It doesn't do much for my skin besides leave it feeling exfoliated, which any scrub can do. As other reviewers have said, the packaging is not shower friendly and it's a loose scrub. So I had to mix this with some coconut oil and clean out an old empty jar to store it in the shower.

They break constantly and you have to replace them all the time... I had no idea I could LOVE a spray bottle until these!<br /><br />I actually use them to keep bug spray and week killer handy in my little garden maintenance kit that I carry around to weed and trim the walkway, fish pond and flower beds. They work awesome! They spray thoroughly, evenly, and easily. They haven't clogged or malfunctioned ONCE yet and they are adorable to boot!<br /><br />They come with a caps to seal the bottle off, if for some reason you don't want to store it with the sprayer in it. This could be really nice for limited space areas where the height of the sprayer wouldn't allow the bottle to fit. It would also be really nice for shipping homemade products.<br /><br />They also come with a little sheet of 'chalk' labels. They are a nice touch, but I find them to be too small for my liking so I'm not using them. I just print a label on my label maker instead.",B089CSR3KF,1600265153228,5.0

The fluorescent ones are BRIGHT. I will be giving those away to my toddler niece. ha ha. I'm not sure why they combined neon colors with earth tones.<br /><br />They were also packaged almost TOO nicely for hair ties!<br />They are all tucked inside in a pretty grey velvet bag... and THEN the velvet bag is packaged inside a pink gift box. I'm not complaining, but I found it humorous when I was opening them! I guess it would make them really good for gifting though.

AG5A4BNLSYHH2IEFJD3UM3N2IPMA,Great Starter Kit,"This is a great starter kit to get you going with gel nails.<br /><br />My only issue with this kit is that it claims to have 'everything you need for a manicure at home' but it doesn't include what some might consider the most IMPORTANT tool... a nail file! Obviously this isn't a big deal, most of us already own a file and if you don't, you can pick on up almost anywhere for $1 or so, but it's the principal for me. LOL. I mean, even the cheapest pack of press-on nails usually includes a tiny emery board file.<br /><br />That's such a minor complaint though.<br /><br />Besides that, I wish the lamp were a bit bigger. I'm not very graceful and tend to bump the side of smaller lamps with my wet nails as I put my hand under the lamp. At the same time, I appreciate the compactness of this whole kit... I'm actually keeping it in my desk at work for emergency touch ups so I'm not complaining about the size, just an observation... it's a matter of preference and need.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this kit for a professional/experienced person, but I DO recommend it for a beginner or as I use it - a compact, portable solution for chipped nails on the go (traveling or at the office).",B0BC273JJR,1598362693336,4.0

Really beautiful roller and I thought the derma roller was really cool...until I read the instructions. “Roll back and forth 4-5 times...only apply light pressure and do not PUNCTURE the skin....sterilize the roller before and after each use for 30 MINUTES in disinfecting alcohol”. Y’all, I’m a busy mom with a toddler, I do not have the time to disinfect something for almost an hour each time I use it, and by use it, I mean roll it 4-5 times total. So while the jade roller is really beautiful and easy to use in of itself, this derma roller kinda seems...extra. I personally would prefer this to just be the roller; I’m too worried about actually using the roller incorrectly and hurting my skin, so I’ll just leave that type of work to the professionals. If you are looking for a jade roller only, there are lots of other options. If you want the full derma experience, then this option would be great for you.",B07HVRP37G,1608666745260,3.0
AEIGRLFPH5Z3EQ73Z23CJ3WX6R6A,It’s nice! But not incredible,"I’m pretty spoiled when it comes to facial products. I would say this is fine, not great, not terrible. It is a nicely packaged one time mask for a little at home spa day, but not something I’d go out and purchase over and over. It would make a really nice stocking stuffer or small gift for someone.",B08GS1G9BH,1608666352035,3.0
AEIGRLFPH5Z3EQ73Z23CJ3WX6R6A,Good option for hand sanitizer,"Clean fresh scent and well moisturized after using. Not greasy at all, very happy with quality of this product.

AEIGRLFPH5Z3EQ73Z23CJ3WX6R6A,Warming sensation is so good,"I love a good face mask - this hits all the marks for me. It is thick and basically feels like wet pottery in your hands (hence the clay), smells nice (somewhat perfume-y) and most importantly, feels like something I’d get at a spa. When I first put it on, I was surprised by the warming sensation, since I didn’t realize it had that effect. I liked it! I’ve had masks like that before and they just add another dimension to the experience. I left it on for 10 minutes and washed it right off. Some clay masks I’ve used are hard to wash off - not this one. Face felt smooth and had no irritation afterward. I really like this brand.",B07M9D3WYW,1599069128559,5.0
AEIGRLFPH5Z3EQ73Z23CJ3WX6R6A,"A pleasant, non-irritating face wash","I like the smell of this and how light it is. It does kinda feel like jelly and doesn’t lather up super great for me, but it gets the job done and makes my face feel good. Haven’t broken out or had irritated skin from it. The smell is light and reminds me of something I can’t put my finger on...maybe light citrus candy or something? It smells pretty good to me and I enjoy washing with this in the shower. Good size too!",B07ZQRX7FX,1597262200568,4.0
AEXPTZ272HHG2KO2JAGU5IL45HIQ,Aesthetically Pleasing and Effective,"The Generation Skin Eye patches really impressed me, considering I initially thought this product was all about aesthetics. With an eye-catching color scheme and translucent blue jelly patches, I loved the look of the jar and color choice. With many eye patches I've tried sight unseen, I really wasn't sure how these would turn out, but I am overall very pleased with their performance. With ingredients like hyaluronic acid and vitamin-rich algae, they left my under eyes nicely moisturized, brightened, and plumped as though I hadn't stared at a screen for eight hours today.<br /><br />Overall I very much enjoy this eye mask, and it feels that it really does work well in moisturizing the under eyes and with a price of $24.95 for 30 eye patches, it a great deal for now, though I have seen the eye patches at a higher price in the past.",B08KWN77LW,1615942211573,4.0
AEXPTZ272HHG2KO2JAGU5IL45HIQ,High Quality Masks that Don't Irritate the Skin,"Overall the Karuna 7 Days of Glow mask set has some good masks that do as they say without irritation. While I don't use face masks every day, it has taken me a while to use just a few of them, and specific masks, like the hydration mask, aren't best suited for my face type. Out of the whole set, my favorite masks have been the brightening and antioxidant masks. While I was slightly hesitant to use the antioxidant mask at first due to my oily combo skin, it left me with no clogged pores or irritation, and it brightened and soothed my skin.<br /><br />As I mentioned initially, I don't use face masks too often, and the masks I usually use are pretty cheap. Trying these masks has ruined me a little because it will be hard to go back to my regular masks. The one thing I don't like about these masks is the price. I think $42 is a little bit much for seven face masks, but it depends on how often you use face masks and how much of a splurge you want them to be. in terms of quality, I think the Karuna masks are great.",B08GYJY8F2,1614452034470,4.0
AEXPTZ272HHG2KO2JAGU5IL45HIQ,Great Value Cleansing Balm for any Skin Type,"The Mizon Cicaluronic Cleansing Balm is a nicely hydrating balm that works well as a first cleanse in a skincare routine. With a price coming in around $17, it's hard to beat its value and quality. With an opaque light blue appearance in the container, it immediately turns into oil after rubbing it in your hands. This balm's scent reminds me of a beach scented candle, and I haven't noticed any irritation to the skin using this product. With calming and hydrating ingredients like Hyaluronic acid and Centella Asiatica, it plumps the skin and prepares it for the next step of your routine.<br /><br />While I wouldn't recommend using this cleansing balm alone, it effortlessly removes any product or makeup on your skin throughout the day. With other cleansing balms for double or triple the price that perform similarly, I highly recommend trying out this cleansing balm in your routine. Even if you don't like the balm, you won't feel nearly as bad compared to buying a more expensive balm.",B08L3J4FB9,1612285629099,5.0
AEXPTZ272HHG2KO2JAGU5IL45HIQ,Great Face Mask,"Being on a face mask kick recently, I go the Easy Dew 2-Step Face Contour Mask to try out. Using the mask twice, I am really impressed by the effectiveness of this mask in terms of the smile lines and under-eye concentration masks. I genuinely can see a difference in my under eyes and the tightness of my face when I use this mask. Having tried another one of the 2-step masks, I do prefer the other mask set with the AHA acid peel for my younger skin. This mask, I think, would be a good option for those who have more mature skin, or who naturally have darker undereye areas. I found it really did brighten my under eyes. I would definitely give this mask a try if you want to focus on your undereye areas or want a boost of hydration in general.",B07P4LLZS6,1596998458635,5.0
AEXPTZ272HHG2KO2JAGU5IL45HIQ,"Nice Moisturizing Mask, but Heavy Fragrance","Being a fan of a weekly face mask, I decided to try Abib Cream Coating Tone-Up Mask. Upon opening the mask the first time, I noticed it's an overpowering scent. After finishing the mask, I found my face broken out from the mask. The mask does seem to have a moisturizing effect, but I believe it is the fragrance that is the culprit of the allergic reaction. If your skin can handle fragrance, I would consider giving this mask a try; otherwise, I would hold off.",B08575Y9V3,1596910677690,3.0

We are going to have to look up the best removal method for dip powder, but the top coat does dry quickly and is very smooth and shiny.<br /><br />Looking at the polish you can almost see the granulated powders.

AE3QBGRRHKT3GFDPRXFEN7JICEZQ,"Great at getting rid of brassiness, not so great at moisturizing","I really wanted to like this set. My initial thoughts on it while applying it in the shower was ""no"" because it provided absolutely no moisturizing qualities to my hair. The conditioner was more like a shampoo and the shampoo was horribly drying! I ended up having to use a seperate extra moisturizing conditioner after I rinsed this out. I was pretty sure this was going to be given away to someone at that point. Then I got out of the shower and styled my hair and it looked really nice and all the brassiness was gone. So now I'm really conflicted. I may end up keeping it with the knowledge that it needs an extra conditioning step but if that becomes annoying these may be given away.",B08QKXY1KN,1625874806742,3.0
AE3QBGRRHKT3GFDPRXFEN7JICEZQ,"Good creams, glitters are sheer","This set is packaged really nicely and includes 20 polishes plus a  base coat and both glossy and matte top coats. The bottles of color are small, super small, only 5ml! And most of the glitters need 3 coats at a minimum so you won't get much use out of those unless you only use them as accent nails. The creams are nice and opaque though, this was a one coater in the pic. I did like that there was a white crelly even though after 3 coats it still wasn't opaque. Ultimately this is an average set. The small size of the bottles and the sheerness of the glitters makes it a 3 star product. There are too many other sets out there that are better to put this one at the top of the list but because of the number of polishes that also includes base/top coats it's still better than others.",B08K8P7LN6,1610636223423,3.0
AE3QBGRRHKT3GFDPRXFEN7JICEZQ,Nice powerful lamp without being too powerful,"I previously purchased a higher watt lamp with the hopes that it would cut down my curing time for doing gels at home.

So far it seems to do the trick for me. Cuts down on the time with no burn! Yay! It has a motion activated sensor so it will turn on to the last setting you used when you put your hand (or foot) in, there are several timed settings that countdown (10,30,60 & 99 low heat) or it will count up without selecting one of those to 120 seconds, and the bottom detaches to do pedicures. Very nice light at a great value!",B08L6GXY2S,1608949327453,5.0
AE3QBGRRHKT3GFDPRXFEN7JICEZQ,SMALL but effective,"Ok, I know the photos of the product show the box that says ""mini-curler"" but nothing in the description indicates how MINI it truly is! I've never owned a 3 barrel iron before so I watched a few videos online while I was waiting for this to arrive. It looked easy enough, though I was questioning the size of the ones they used versus the what I ordered. The barrel is 3/4"" so I knew that would make for a tighter curl regardless and I was ok with that. What I didn't think about was the overall size of the whole thing. It's tiny, like really, really small lol I attached a pic of me holding it, it's like a play curling iron for a child lol BUT it does work! I was able to curl through all of my hair in no time at all and it left me feeling like I got a perm in 10 mins (see pic of my hair straight vs curled)! Not something I'm going to want to do on a regular basis. I think I want more of a relaxed wave for that which means a much larger barrel size, but for special occasions when I do want my hair curly this will do the trick nicely.<br />A separate, tiny complaint is the inability to adjust the heat setting. I have very thin hair and I generally don't use very high heat settings on my other curlers/straighteners but this one was either on or off, no adjustment for heat so I had to make sure to not hold my hair in for too long so I wouldn't risk breaking it off. It's not the most ideal situation but it is a fairly easy fix to just err on the side of not long enough rather than too long.",B08NPBQR9L,1608937090209,4.0
AE3QBGRRHKT3GFDPRXFEN7JICEZQ,Beautiful fall set,"These colors are perfect for the fall season. They come in a really nice gift set package and include a bas and top coat so your giftee will be all ready to go...as long as they already have a lamp ;) The colors on the bottles are very accurate as to what is inside the bottle, which is really good considering a lot of the time color accuracy is the biggest issue. I swatched one color; it was two coats of perfection. The formula is a lot like regular polish rather than gel, meaning it glides on really well and you don't have to manipulate it to get good coverage. The top coat cured in 30 seconds which I was super excited about. Some other brands I have tried recently have needed 120+ seconds to cure which just makes the process way too long for me. Overall I am really happy with this brand and this set. I wish they had more colors to try. Once they do, I'm sure I'll be making another purchase!",B08HZ5Y8RY,1607711960694,5.0
AE3QBGRRHKT3GFDPRXFEN7JICEZQ,Fun!,"This set does not come with a base or top coat but DOES come with the necessary black polish that you will want to use under these colors. They are incredibly sheer polishes and to use without a black base you will not be able to get full, opaque coverage. With the black base though these polishes really stand out. They are unique to anything else I have in my gel polish collection and is similar to what you would find in the indie polish world of regular polishes. I swatched them on black swatch sticks and I only needed one coat to get the look I was going for. They were just thick enough to get good coverage but not so thick they were goopy. I'm looking forward to wearing these colors!",B085SY4WC3,1607711628586,5.0

AHTOPAM4UMS6AZRFWMBBXWNYYEVQ,Nice Light Lotion; Mild Moisturizing Effect,"I love aloe and was excited to try this product. This is a very pleasant aloe-based lotion (not the same as the aloe gel). It is supposed to be moisturizing but is very light and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly and only provides a mild moisturizing effect. My skin is not very dry, so I imagine someone with dryer skin would need a much heavier lotion if using as a moisturizer. It does feel soothing and makes my skin feel smooth. I like the mild aloe scent. This is a value pack with 4 lotions in a set. Each comes in its own gift box, which is really nice in case you want to give one to someone as a present. I wish there was an option for a variety pack since it comes with 4 lotions. Overall, this is a decent lotion and is a great value.",B08LPGZMQK,1623410256149,4.0
AHTOPAM4UMS6AZRFWMBBXWNYYEVQ,Very Refreshing and Smells Amazing!,"I got the Cucumber and Aloe body wash. The smell is amazing! The cucumber also makes my skin feel so refreshed.  The consistency of the wash is thick and creamy. The product lathers very well and creates a rich foam. It feels good on the skin, not irritating, and does a great job at cleansing. I had a hard time getting the pump opened initially. I even looked for instructions on the bottle on how to open the pump. It was almost child proof, but I finally got it.  Once opened, the pump worked well and dispensed the product with no issues. The 2-pack is a great value, with each bottle containing 24.5 oz. I am very happy with this body wash and definitely recommend it!",B08SG2MBRY,1621780887961,5.0
AHTOPAM4UMS6AZRFWMBBXWNYYEVQ,Hair Stays Wet And Wraps Take Forever To Dry,"Got this for my daughter. She has medium-long hair and makes turbans out of regular towels all the time, so I thought that she would enjoy this. The hair wraps are cute and soft to the touch, so they feel comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, some of the strings were loose, so not a very high quality sewing.  Because the product is made with soft microfiber material, it does not work as well as a regular towel to dry the hair. The cap is even less effective than the turban, because the hair stays loose inside and the moisture does not absorb. My daughter complained that she wore the wrap for a while and when she took it off, her hair was still very wet. She told me that the regular towels work much better. The material also takes forever to dry once it gets wet, unlike a regular towel. Therefore, I wish that the product was made of an actual towel material. I think it would have worked much better for the intended purpose.",B0841WQNNZ,1605973716644,3.0
AHTOPAM4UMS6AZRFWMBBXWNYYEVQ,Nice Make-Up Wheel With Subtle Colors,"This is a lovely make-up wheel. It comes with 9 colors to choose from, 5 of which are matte and the rest shimmer. The matte shadows don't cake and the shimmer ones go on smoothly and are not greasy. I like the blend of the colors in the set, they are nicely matched. I like that the colors are subtle, yet provide a good variety for you to play around with and express yourself. The wheel does spin, but only when it is closed, which is not a functional feature and is just for aesthetics. Once you open the lid, the wheel locks in place. I wish there was a way to rotate it once the lid is open. It also did not come with any brush or applicator, but this is not a big deal because I am sure many of us have our own favorite applicator brushes.",B08F7877DC,1598100947640,4.0

AHPG65LKS3QKRWDUWAKZNLEK5RZQ_1,Excellent magnetic lashes!,"I love these. I like that they are mink. And I especially like how they have the little case with a mirror. That’s impossible to find. They work great and stay on my whole 12 hour shift. They are waterproof and you can’t scrub off with just water, not that a person would try. Cold cream works ok. But if you get some lash cleaner or makeup remover and apply to the end of a cotton swab and gently rub along lash, they practically fall off in seconds. At first, I was peeling them off because I thought since it’s magnetic that’s all that’s sticking. But then it’s hard to get the eyeliner off. After using a remover it’s much better. Don’t worry if you have trouble using liquid eyeliner. I promise after practicing a time or two, it will work perfect. If you get out of line, very quickly wipe off excess. It dries quickly. If it takes longer to put them on after applying liner, it will probably still work good. If you put lashes on sooner than you are supposed to and it’s not dried as well as it should be, it still works. It’s just a little messier for the lashes after removing them. I’ve learned to also use my lash remover or makeup remover to clean my lashes afterwards. They will have some liner dried to them and this builds up. I put them in my palm and squirt some on and gently rub with my finger or a swab. I don’t take much effort but get some of it off pretty good. They last me a good 5 or more times depending on how bad I bend them putting on lol. That’s another thing, you don’t have to have a real steady hand to apply them. I use my fingers instead of the holder thing. I normally start in the center but sometimes on the inside. You can adjust them if they are too long on one side. You can also trim them. Please don’t do this while they are on lol. I tried this and cut too much off. I was lazy lol. Most the time I have mine bent good to put on. Well, I should say curved instead of bent lol. They aren’t as fragile as they would seem. I love them. Only thing that worries me, if you ever are in an accident with them on and they take you for an MRI , I worry my eyelids will pull off because of the magnetic particles lol. It’s not funny but something to think about. Surely they would wash them off first. Don’t think about it. Try them. After all, beauty comes at a price lol.",B08NTD1NM1,1620372579752,5.0
AHPG65LKS3QKRWDUWAKZNLEK5RZQ_1,Moisturizes without being oily,"I haven’t had this too long but just the week I’ve tried it I’ve noticed a difference. I have combination skin, closer to oily. Lately I’ve needed a little more moisture. This is just right. It feels like it would be great for dry skin and oily. Maybe a little too much for oily, idk. It’s not too thick. At first, when applying it, it seems thick. But it quickly absorbs. Right away actually. It doesn’t have a strong scent. My skin feels great the next day when I wake up. I usually apply it twice a day and it’s not too oily. As I learned in cosmetology school, there’s a difference in oil and moisture. This moisturizes without being oily.",B08QVJ4NVD,1620370747167,5.0

AHPG65LKS3QKRWDUWAKZNLEK5RZQ_1,The best eyeshadow I’ve ever used and stays on over 12 hours,"I was skeptical a little at first of this. I’ve tried another brand of white before and it was like water. Also, I’m not good at applying liquid eyeshadow. But let me tell you, I applied this with the applicator. It’s a sponge tip like will come in lipstick or lip gloss. Then I sort of blended it in just a little with my finger. It dries on and stays the whole work night 12 hours. It’s great. It feels a little like when something liquid would dry on skin but not bad and doesn’t show wrinkles. It may be for younger people but this 50 year old loves it. You wouldn’t believe the head turns and compliments I receive. People asked what it’s called and where I got it. I can’t stress enough how great it is. It’s the best I’ve ever used.",B08DK5D9J5,1611735061141,5.0

AHPG65LKS3QKRWDUWAKZNLEK5RZQ_1,Beyond my expectations,"So even though I used to do hair and should know about magnetic eyelashes, I didn’t and I was SO skeptical. I finally decided to try them. These things exceeded my expectations by far! The first time I chose the not so dramatic ones but they were thicker than my own. They did great. They were only a tad heavy. They stayed on 8 hours but I took the eyeliner with me to work and touched them up. I honestly think they would’ve stayed on longer if I hadn’t have forgotten and put regular eyeliner on first out of habit. I do wish this came in another color besides black as I have blonde hair and it’s dramatic. But once I wore them a while I realized it looked good. After work, I removed them easily. My eyes were itchy a little but when I woke up that evening they were back to normal. Another reason I think they didn’t stay on 12 hours was instead of following directions, I read somewhere that a person put the eyeliner on the the lashes while still wet and it worked better. The next night I followed directions. Put a coat on let dry then add another coat. Honestly, it pretty much dries by the time you finish both eyes. Don’t forget to shake it up though. They were very easy and quick to do. The only real time it takes is deciding which ones to use as there are so many nice selections. I realized the ones I thought were too dramatic when choosing actually look the best. I’ve gotten o many complements. And this time they stayed on all night. I think I could sleep in them and they would stay on. I wouldn’t though. The corners might poke your skin on inner eye when you close them but this can be remedied by snipping a tad off with scissors once you try them on and see how they do. I didn’t have to trim mine. Also, I had put a pair on and decided I liked the longer ones better so I took off the first ones and applied the others. I never redid the eyeliner. They still worked and stayed on. There’s magnet particles on eyeliner and the lashes are on a magnet strip. They are easy to remove but stay on like they are real. That sounds crazy. I didn’t want to ruin my own lashes with the glue kind plus I can’t get them on good enough without adjusting them. These you can take off and adjust. This gave me confidence I lacked in doing this. Plus, my hands aren’t that steady. When removing, start at corner and peel off. They won’t hurt your lashes. To remove eyeliner I used cold cream. It worked well. Just water doesn’t work. It is waterproof very much so. So cry all you want with these lashes ladies. You won’t have to worry about them falling off. One last thing, my skin is sensitive but they haven’t really bothered me so that is a big plus.",B08DNCR582,1604908215837,5.0
AGLW4RPFGBKWE3FBZBEP2JWUIOCA,Pretty and at a good price point.,"Let’s establish this first, everyone rates things differently- this is how I do it:<br /><br />5 stars: The item fully meets OR exceeds expectations<br />4 stars: There could be improvements, but the product is good<br />3 stars: The item is acceptable, but might be better elsewhere, or needs improvement<br />2 stars: Many or most things are wrong with the item, but it has some redeemable feature<br />1 star: Stay Away! It’s a bad buy.<br /><br />In those stars I try to include: How closely the product meets the description, Price, How it compares to other products I’ve tried, and Usability.<br /><br />My reviews can be long, so if you want to skim, follow the topic headers. Also-I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />My nail experience:<br />I am currently NOT a nail tech but I am practicing to become licensed. It’s something I enjoy—but is still a hobby.  I practice weekly, if not daily- on myself, hand mannequins, and other people. Sometimes I’m told to hurry up getting licensed- that I’m ""good enough""—but I’m in no hurry, busy trying out as many products as I can, watching nail content on YouTube and SkillShare.<br />SO--Though I am knowledgeable, I recommend you always trust licensed nail teaches over me.<br /><br />Art liner brushes-- overall look:<br />I'm a sucker for the embedded crystals look that these brushes have. Its a common look for nail brushes- this style is everywhere, but I always find it pretty. The crystals are loose, wiggling around in the open center- sometimes making a faint clicking noise. This style always looks bougie to me.<br /><br />The brush tips:<br />these preform fine- had a few brush hairs I had to get wet and smooth-- nothing bad. after a little forming they do what they are intended to do. If you're new to brushes like these, the long fine lines help create smoother thin lines and the stubby brushes are good for more precise detail.<br /><br />Cost:<br />At the time of this review these brushes cost 6.99. for five brushes that's roughly 1.25 for each brush. Not a bad cost. You can get better brushes- they'll have less imperfections and will cost more-- but these do fine.<br /><br />I see these brushes everywhere-- and the'll randomly pop up at different price points- sometimes even as a free bonus for a more expensive nail kit. So if you want to shop around you may be able to find them cheeper-- but I still think this is a good price.<br /><br />Overall:<br />They are what they say they are.

AGLW4RPFGBKWE3FBZBEP2JWUIOCA,The magnetic eyeliner perfected--,"Let’s establish this first, everyone rates things differently- this is how I do it:<br /><br />5 stars: The item fully meets OR exceeds expectations<br />4 stars: There could be improvements, but the product is good<br />3 stars: The item is acceptable, but might be better elsewhere OR needs improvement<br />2 stars: Many OR most things are wrong with the item, but it has some redeemable feature<br />1 star: Stay Away! It’s a bad buy.<br /><br />In those stars I try to include: How closely the product meets the description, Price, How it compares to other products I’ve tried, and Usability.<br /><br />My reviews can be long, so if you want to skim, follow the topic headers. Also- I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />My experience:<br />I'm not a makeup expert-- but when magnetic eyelashes first came out, I was a customer- so I’ve watched the market change over the years. At the time of this review you’ll finally find different styles of lashes, but all of them will be a bit stiff, and thick. Not many options for soft natural looking lashes in with magnetic application.<br /><br />The lashes styles:<br />These lashes have a decent range as magnetic lashes go with a few of the wispier, natural-ish options. So far though I haven’t seen any magnetic lashes on the market that look natural.<br /><br />Liner applicator:<br />This isn’t THE best liner applicator I’ve tried, but it is comparable to the best. In my experience the liner is the most important part of the lash set- not just because it’s the “glue” but it’s the item that makes the most difference on ease of application and finished look. Some liners are thick no matter what you do, this one allows a thinner line. (BUT magnetic lashes don’t do well with a pin line application, meaning you must add enough for the lash to grab on to) this made a thinner line work for me., (please note I have wrinkled and hooded eyelids, so everything I do is a little bumpy/ big)<br /><br />FIRST TIME USERS: these work best if you do ONE eye at a time. The lashes apply best when the liner is still a bit wet. NOT fully wet- but given a little time to START to dry. Think of the liner like glue- perfectly wet glue doesn’t hold paper together, and dry glue doesn’t stick.<br /><br />I recommend testing this liner on the back of your hand before your eyes, so you don’t end up looking like a panda as you practice—and the skin on your hand isn’t as sensitive as your eyelid. As you practice, remember that the lashes are reusable BUT can break easily --so practice with the set you like LEAST and be careful as you apply and remove.)<br /><br />Overall-<br />I recommend this set. There are MANY magnetic eylashe sets on the market, and this is one of the good ones.<br /><br />I’ll update this post with eye looks as I use each lash set and change my review if I see anything that should be mentioned.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!!",B086GST51S,1597967418816,5.0
AGLW4RPFGBKWE3FBZBEP2JWUIOCA,I wouldn't start with this--,"This is a beginner set, but it's not looking to help you-- No instructions.<br /><br />Lucky for me--This isn't my first gel kit.<br /><br />At first when I opened the box I liked how much they had to offer creatively. Some kits try to force a look, but this one was open to play with. Maybe not the best idea for a beginner kit- but I enjoyed that.<br /><br />First the good:<br />I like this type of lamp when I'm doing gel- it's easy together both my hands in to hold the nail down when I first start, then I usually pick up the light and rotate it to get a full cure. Yes I have to restart the lamp a few times, but this isn't an expensive lamp so I don't mind.<br /><br />I liked the little box they came in- sure it's cheep, but it was a nice tough to have (almost) everything in once place.<br /><br />Then the annoying:<br /><br />There are a lot of odd little problems, like the Gel itself, two are jelly clear and one is opaque. Opaque gel takes a little longer to cure because the light works a bit harder to travel though the nail. It would have been helpful if they mentioned that, OR only gave you one type of gel-so it doesn't confuse you-- but they didn't.<br /><br />The nail forms were a bad fir for my hand. Thats just an unlucky break- all hands are diffrent- so im not including that in my rating, just something to mention in case they don't work for you too.<br /><br />The colors were a little annoying to use, no color indicator on the bottle. this is common with cheeper sets, but I thought I'd mention it anyway- It can make doing your nails just a little bothersome.<br /><br />The ugly-<br />they don't include slip solution-I ended up using my own from my nail kit, so I didn't have any problems, but that's a huge mistake on their part-- if you're just starting out you'll think gel nails are a sticky mess. Slip solution makes them manageable.<br /><br />Overall- I feel like there are better kits that will give you a cleaner start over this one--<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!",B087G54FLM,1597208143749,3.0
AGLW4RPFGBKWE3FBZBEP2JWUIOCA,They'll do,These do the job.<br /><br />There are a lot of these on the market- nothing wrong with this set.<br />They didn't do anything extra- like throw in a few extra wax heads like some companies do- but they didn't need to.<br /><br />Really- the reason to get these is if you like the colors-- the way they look.<br /><br />If you like em- then this is the set for you.<br /><br />If you've never had one of these for placing bling and glitter flakes-- they are so helpful-- the wax keeps picking things up over and over and the other side helps you position things instead of poking them endlessly with an orange sick. There are more expensive ones that don't use wax- but this works.<br /><br />I hope that was helpful.,B085RQKWNF,1596966237071,4.0
AGLW4RPFGBKWE3FBZBEP2JWUIOCA,Please - just go buy a topcoat.,"Oh my word- no.<br /><br />Okay- so this looked like a wonderful beginner kit. I am not a beginner, but I was excited to have everything in a tiny package- something easy to pull out with friends but with high quality results.<br /><br />I got a friend, we opened the box and assumed I'd be ready to do her nails without getting my nail kit.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />The first sept (as it always is) was to clean buff and shape the nail- nothing included to do that.<br /><br />I thought- okay- no big deal.<br /><br />I got my stuff out and took care of it. I then applied their prep product- Nail dehydrator- all good.<br /><br />I started to plug in the nail light, so I’d be ready after we apply the first coat- but this kit didn't include a plug- just a usb cord. (sigh) I got up again- and got an extra usb plug I had. Now slightly annoyed because this is supposed to be a ready kit-<br /><br />but hey-- really-- not a huge deal.<br /><br />Then I applied the base coat. Whew- runny. I wasn’t impressed with it’s consentaneity. But maybe it’d perform well?<br /><br />Then I tried to cure it. Cue the light--<br /><br />Oh, my word their nail lamp is horrible.<br /><br />It’s very cheap looking- only fits four fingers- not the thumb at the same time, and really feels off- like the break into shards plastic, not the bendy kind. (I was still trying to accept this as a no big deal point but the red flags were slapping me in the face.)<br /><br />I read the pamphlet to see how long it needed to cure- the pamphlet said ""cure for the appropriate time"" or something just a vague. I read the nail polish, to find the appropriate time- nope. I looed over the box- nothing.<br /><br />We used the lamp like 5 times and finally got her base coat cured. Then we had to do the same with just her thumb. I have nail lights that cost three bucks that work better than this thing. I’m not kidding.  In fact- I use single nail lights that only cure one nail at a time—and this was SLOWER!<br /><br />Okay- that was over.<br /><br />Where is the red polish?<br /><br />The box says: “Step two apply polish” and it has a picture of the polish- a red polish, they name it like it’s included.<br /><br />It’s not.<br /><br />This starter kit isn’t much of a START without a polish-<br /><br />but Okay- my nail kit to save the day.<br /><br />I pulled out a blush pink gel that always does me right.<br /><br />But the base coat is weird. The polish is almost clumping on the nail. It applies a tad bit patchy. I get that not all formulas work together—but they DIDN’T GIVE ME a polish to work with so theirs- in theory- should be mostly universal. I didn’t know I was intended to buy-one polishe- AND their kit to make this happen.<br /><br />I try to cure MY gel polish tin their lamp.<br />(thank goodness my friend is a very laid-back person- she was amazing about this, laughing with me--) I was itching to pull out a good lamp but I didn’t, so I’d give this a true test.<br />(Or because I wanted to test my patience. Two birds one stone)<br /><br />Now—here is the saving grace—<br /><br />the top coat is wonderful.<br /><br />It works like some of my best top coats- it leaves that perfect glassy look and it applies like a dream.<br /><br />Later I used the same top coat on my nails- and it worked just as well without the weird base coat and the horrible lamp and a totally different brand of nail polish.<br /><br />THIS WHOLE KIT AND THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE GOING FOR IT IS THE TOP COAT!<br />Now I get why this has good reviews—it’s the gel top coat.<br /><br />No wonder it lasts- I can only guess Red Carpet knows their top coat is fantastic, so they threw a bunch of bad apples in here –aware beginners won’t know any better.<br /><br />Please. You can buy wonderful topcoats for 10-20 bucks NOT 50 OF YOUR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS- This is such a sad waste- and they don’t even throw in a file, or a plug in or red polish?<br /><br />I have more stuff coming from this brand—things I got before I tried this-- that I’m going to be trying-<br />I really hope this is their only issue... we shall see. <br /><br />I hope this review was helpful because I don’t want your money wasted. :(",B0BC273JJR,1596965574088,2.0

This company offers different scent options - this one is rather flowery, with scents like ylang ylang and gardenia. This is certainly somewhat expensive for a deodorant but it is worth paying extra to get something natural with organic ingredients that won't irritate your skin or harm your health. Unlike some products that just spray on scents this item uses baking soda to help absorb odors too.

AEODUUL6REW3PW2ZGFREKGWBYUZA,Good little start,"I like this manicure kit but wish it came with gel polish. It’s like a pre starter kit for me, it’s good for someone who just wants shiny nails. I used my own gel polish and did a cute manicure with this kit. The light cured well and the purify solution did prep my nails for better adhesion.",B0BC273JJR,1595832366906,4.0
AEODUUL6REW3PW2ZGFREKGWBYUZA,Ok drill,This is a nice  drill. Very sleek and was able to file and sand my nails well with it. It did a lot better than I expected and way better than those pink plastic drills. Love that it comes with drill bits. Hate that you have to push the drill bits in and you can’t lock it in place.,B088NVJSJT,1595660760057,4.0
AEODUUL6REW3PW2ZGFREKGWBYUZA,Very good,This blow dryer is so amazing. It’s not extremely noisy and very sleek and easy to use. Definitely love doing blow outs with this!!,B082VYX7G8,1595653036161,5.0
AEODUUL6REW3PW2ZGFREKGWBYUZA,Huge,I like this makeup organizer because it holds a lot of my full size products. It was easy to assemble and looks cute.,B07X8W7GJZ,1581966867172,5.0
AEODUUL6REW3PW2ZGFREKGWBYUZA,Love these products,My hands are dry and cracked. These products haven’t made my hands feel softer and moisturized.  I was extremely pleased they have a skin cream too. I use the cream on my elbows and other dry patches of skin. I have seen some improvement on my elbows where it isn’t as rough.,B082VKPJV5,1581192014601,5.0
AEODUUL6REW3PW2ZGFREKGWBYUZA,Smells good,It smells like perfume. I haven’t noticed a huge difference with my skin yet but I only have been  using it a few days. The lotion isn’t thick but lightweight and smells so good!,B07SW7D6ZR,1581012877697,5.0
AEODUUL6REW3PW2ZGFREKGWBYUZA,Too cute,Definitely love these! They are so cute! I love that they come with a variety of colors so I could switch them up.,B0837K9W6P,1580787889903,5.0
AFY3DF5ZXFAWH5ADLZPJYCW2IM2Q,"Smells great, doesn't linger","This linen spray smells fresh and clean without being too overwhelming. I did deduct one star because it doesn't last long at all but it does smell nice for a short time. Currently, there is no retail price listed for me to compare value but I would definitely consider purchasing again.  It would also make a nice gift, perhaps as an addition to a gift basket or housewarming.",B08T7GPT1D,1625788963231,4.0
AFY3DF5ZXFAWH5ADLZPJYCW2IM2Q,Moisturizing and easy to use,"This mask feels really awesome! It is easy to use and left my skin feeling very moisturized. Great for a little pampering every week. My only issue is the price; $6+ per treatment seems a little high to me but that's just my opinion. Overall, it's a great product.",B08BS3WDPJ,1599874092094,4.0
AFY3DF5ZXFAWH5ADLZPJYCW2IM2Q,Hydrating serum,"I was a bit shocked at how greasy this serum is the first time I used it. I expected it to absorb a little better and not stay so ""shiny"". That being said, it has not caused my skin to break out or look any oilier throughout the day. I use it in the evenings after washing my face and before my moisturizer. A little goes a looong way so this small bottle will last a really long time.<br /><br />I have only been using it for a little over a week but my skin already looks better.  Definitely more hydrated and smooth. This is a great addition to my skincare routine, I highly recommend.",B07DFNPVSF,1598566625667,5.0
AFY3DF5ZXFAWH5ADLZPJYCW2IM2Q,SO easy to apply!,"Let me start by saying that these are the easiest eyelashes that I have ever used.  I was definitely skeptical but it really is as easy as swiping on the magnetic liner and then sticking the lash strip in place.  THAT IS IT!  No fussing, no dropping, no glue, no 2-piece magnet that you can't ever position properly.  Just swipe and stick.  Pretty much foolproof!  I did find them to be a tad heavy on my eyelid but I imagine that is because I'm not used to wearing false lashes (because I could never figure how to get them on properly...haha) and I'm hoping it will get better with time.<br /><br />Ok...now onto the negative.  While these lashes are absolutely amazing, I was appalled to receive a used tube of eyeliner in my pack.  You know the black thread rings that mascara tubes develop after you have removed and inserted the wand a hundred times?  That's exactly what the eyeliner tube looked like.  A 'sealed' package that contained a used product?  Not really sure how that happened.  Luckily, the kit contains 2 tubes of eyeliner so I went against my better judgement and decided to try the tube that was obviously (maybe I should say hopefully) not used.<br /><br />Other than receiving a partially used product, these eyelashes are AMAZING.  So easy and fun, I highly recommend!!",B087GD4BJ1,1593446244710,4.0
AFY3DF5ZXFAWH5ADLZPJYCW2IM2Q,Great find!,This sanitizer is a great find!  It did not dry my hands out or leave them feeling sticky.  The package arrived quickly and both bottles were tightly wrapped.  I have not been able to find sanitizer in stores and was so excited to find it on Amazon.  Very pleased!,B087D7MVHB,1592490290849,5.0
AE23ZBUF2YVBQPH2NN6F5XSA3QYQ,Comes fully assembled!,"For once, this comes with everything already assembled AND comes with scrunchies!  Depending on what kind of hair ties you are using, this could hold anywhere from 8 scrunchies to 50 hair ties. It literally comes fully assembled, ready to be used right out of the box. The scrunchies are cute and functional! All the rage these days with youth. The only thing I notice that is different about this one than others is that it doesn't have the open cylinder at the top. Most of the others have an open top for bobbie pins and clips. However, that is not a negative as it literally is perfectly sized and comes with everything needed. And even better, it's the perfect less than $10 item for birthdays or gifts at $9.99 at the time of review.",B08S3B8Y5G,1618364173630,5.0
AE23ZBUF2YVBQPH2NN6F5XSA3QYQ,Non-Toxic and Fun for Hours!,"This is a favorite for the little girls. They think that they are one of us adults because they get to paint their nails and stick them under the dryer just like us. This actually gets a 5/5 for me given that it comes with a lot of stuff, easy to open packaging, and is a good price.<br /><br />The nail polish wins for the adults because it is non-toxic and easy to remove. It comes with so many options for nail colors, stickers, and the dryer. You definitely want 2AA batteries handy for the dryer. It doesn't come with them. For the price though, this really will be a hit for your kids!",B08CVTNQP1,1612045529856,5.0
AE23ZBUF2YVBQPH2NN6F5XSA3QYQ,Great Quality for a Cheaper Price,"At the price of $20 (at the time of review), these lashes get a 4/5 stars for the quality, quantity, and price.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Cute carrying case for travel.<br />-Good variety and style of lashes<br />-Strong grip<br />-Strong black color<br />-Short and small styles<br />-Stay on until makeup remover is used<br /><br />Cons<br />-If you like thick lashes, these are not for you.<br />-Smudges a bit<br />-",B08NTD1NM1,1612042902251,4.0
AE23ZBUF2YVBQPH2NN6F5XSA3QYQ,No more chapped lips!,"Moisturizing and flavorful at the same time! I swear we go through chapstick like no tomorrow here. The tubes are the usual size and with a large pack, come in handy for keeping around the house and cars. These would also be great for stocking stuffers for the holidays! The flavors are strongly scented, but mild enough to not pick away if the taste were stronger. Overall, these are a great pick for an affordable yet well protected chapstick.",B08G5YVHQP,1605147612884,4.0
AE23ZBUF2YVBQPH2NN6F5XSA3QYQ,Love the Turban,"I'm such a lazy beauty enthusiast. I soak in the tub using luxurious bath bombs, spend hours playing with hair products, yet still wrap my hair up every night even though I have two blow dryers and a hand full of hair dryer brushes. I still just prefer to leave my hair wrapped up until bed and deal with the messy curly consequences the next morning. This is by far the BEST hair wraps I've ever used. It is made if microfiber and is soft as blankets. The turban is great for just throwing your hair in there, while the hair towel wraps up nicely and has a good button and band on it to hold it in place. The two hair ties are nice, but not needed. Still useful though! The towels themselves absorb all of the water and hold it in place. So, once you take the towels off, they are soaked for hours, unlike your hair. These are by far the best hair towels I've ever left in my hair for hours at a time.",B0841WQNNZ,1604545336317,5.0
AE23ZBUF2YVBQPH2NN6F5XSA3QYQ,Spa Day!!!,"[[VIDEOID:f054bc1ef56dd4b625a57cf8672d7c56]] This has EVERYTHING I need to clean up in the evening or have a spa day at home. Plenty of face masks, plenty of eye masks and it even comes with a cute lip collagen mask. The face scrubber is soft and I love freezing the eye mask and wearing it in the tub. You can wear it warm or cold. The whole kit would be great for a birthday gift or wedding shower gift since it is neatly packaged.",B08BF4BKKM,1601079378337,4.0
AE23ZBUF2YVBQPH2NN6F5XSA3QYQ,Shine or Grease?,"I'm slightly indifferent to this shampoo. We use argan oil shampoo often but this one is hit or miss. It makes my hair more greasy than shiny while it works great for my husbands. It does lather pretty well and the bottle is large, but it just didn't cut it for mine. I have thick hair and what we thought was the extra shine left a layer of grease on my brush the next day. Not typical for my hair and my wash schedule.",B087ZQK2G8,1600100960642,3.0
AE23ZBUF2YVBQPH2NN6F5XSA3QYQ,A Little Itchy,The concept behind these hair ties  are great but they are itchy if you wear them on your wrist. As far as stretch goes though they do well for a couple of wears. I found them to be a lot looser after a week. Cute but not the best.,B081D2R47W,1600086458543,3.0

Unfortunately, they are super perfume scented, but the perfume goes away in just a moment of two in the bath. I used 2 in one bath and was disappointed that the scent didn't linger for much longer than it did. Especially since the description specifies that it would be great for sinuses! These are more for children who don't enjoy the spa setting as much and just want colorful tubs.",B089R7S73D,1598559204579,3.0

AEJU3Z6HDAERETMYI2CXBQVPPDFA,Pink Jeweled Headband,Headband is beautiful and very feminine. The only problem is the lining of the Headband has to be reinforced with a hot glue gun. Lining was literally lifting up and about to fall off. Once lining was glued down headband was beautiful. The beading is intricately sewn together. Headband is fit for a princess.,B08HQSK576,1609632905389,4.0

AEZUL3R34WWAORYARPTJG2X6KC5Q_1,Works better than ones that cones nearly 2x the price,"I absolutely love these types of nano facial misters and have purchased quite a few over the last 6 months or so both higher and lower end. This TIANG one is about mid level price wise, but I actually thing this works better in a lot of aspects than my more expensive one that costs about 2x the price!<br /><br />My favorite facial mister prior to this was the Flight Mode Cloud Mister which is usually between $40-$50 depending on if it’s on sale or not at that time. And personally I think this TIANG one works even better!<br /><br />First you can actually put an watery essence in this TIANG one, unlike the Flight mode one that doesn’t allow it. This TIANG one also has a better spray than my flight mode one. The flight mode one is insanely fine, honestly it’s actually to fine but it was still my favorite up until now. This TIANG one is slightly stronger of a spray which is enough to really mist your face without feeling like you dumping skincare or water on your skin. This TIANG one also holds a charge longer and I can easily get a day or two out of it even if I am using it frequently throughout the day.<br /><br />The only real negative is the size of this TIANG one bits much larger than my old one and most of the others I have tried. But other than that this is a fantastic machine and I would highly recommend! Sometimes it’s the really simple things that work best!",B09671G4KH,1629537832933,5.0
AEZUL3R34WWAORYARPTJG2X6KC5Q_1,Terrible spray nozzle and scent is more like perfume,"Not really a fan of this Florona Hibiscus room freshener. First it claims to be a room and pillow spray, but it’s not, or at least this scent isn’t. It’s not relaxing at all and it’s way to strong for a pillow spray.<br /><br />Generally I love hibiscus scents, but there is just something really off about this one, it’s almost perfume like. Plus the sprayer nozzle on this is terrible. It shouts out huge droplets that splatter everywhere and leak down the container and onto my hand every time. They put two different caps on this, but then the sprayer is terrible… why? Overall I was just really unimpressed by this. I have tried other products from this brand like there essential oils, and I have generally liked them. But this is just a huge miss for me.",B08T7GPT1D,1627757097231,2.0
AEZUL3R34WWAORYARPTJG2X6KC5Q_1,"Pillow spray leaked everywhere, but it smelled really good","While I really like this Tiny Buddha Mindfullness set, mine came completely soaked, so much that the box was falling apart. The culprit was the pillow spray that had leaked almost completely out since the lid wasn’t on securely. Which is a shame because I absolutely love pillow sprays and use them every single night, and this one smelled really good.<br /><br />That being said the rest of the set was just ok for me. The candle does smell good, but it is super tiny and only burned for a few hours before it was gone. The shower gel smells amazing, but didn’t lather as well as I hoped and the scent didn’t linger. And the essential oil roll on was alright, though it smelled kind of musty or something. I would have given this 4 stars if the pillow spray wasn’t leaked everywhere, but it was, so only 3 stars.",B08P5579KC,1623812153483,3.0

It releases just the right amount of handsanitzer I was worried that it will make a big mess while no one place their hand on the sensor but the sensor is tuck under the release spout . Battery Life  has lasted a long time so  far I've been using it for a month and battery life is still good. I didn't use very liquid hand sanitizer so I do have to sometimes swipe the last drop on the tip. I think if I use the other kind it will work better but for now this is fine I’m very happy with it.,B089YGZZYP,1601999494436,4.0

He highly recommends this Self/ish scrub.,B08BFH35VX,1598500070635,5.0
AGQVYRFKX6G5VO65RHQ7UZKGSTKQ,So Many choices,Every print is beautiful. This is an amazing deal. My daughter is very picky anything to tight or loose around her head  she won't wear.

Perfect size just like the nail salon ones even has a motion sensor. 150 w is perfect anything lower takes longer to cure.",B085ZRVDKP,1596061224033,5.0
AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Perfect for any mermaid or unicorn lover,I love anything that has a unicorn or mermaid color scheme to it. These make up brushes are so pretty and are actually amazingly soft and work extremely well. Sometimes you forgo quality for looks but that’s not the case with these brushes. They are super well-made and I haven’t had any problem with bristles falling out. I highly recommend this set.,B0919R1CYT,1634937311829,5.0
AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Finally! Some top coats with pizzazz,I really love this set because it actually will take any color and add a little pizzazz. I really appreciate the fact that they included six white peel off stickers that you can either use to do a sample of the color inside each bottle or put a name on it. I chose to do the latter. They go on smooth and take probably 90 seconds to cure under the UV light. But this is a must have set for anybody doing gel nails.,B08W4WQMNM,1621107418771,5.0
AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Good shampoo and conditioner,So maybe I wasn’t sure exactly what I should expect after using the shampoo and conditioner. I know you’re supposed to use a different shampoo and conditioner at least once a week to get rid of build up. That’s what I was expecting this to be. It does a good job and my hair feels soft and nourished afterwards. I’m not real thrilled about the scent because it reminds me of Pantene. John Freida always puts out a top quality product so this is right up there. Definitely worth the once a week switch.,B08XJWLLKQ,1619916033214,4.0
AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Satin Braided with Pearls,This peachy pink color and mint color are very spring like. Great set to have for those pastels that we’ll be wearing in March April and May.

AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Beautiful and comfortable,"So in the past year, I have started collecting headbands because my hair has been thinning on top and it’s a great way to disguise it. At this point I have about 30 headbands and this has got to be one of my favorites! You would think it would be uncomfortable or heavy with all of the rhinestones embedded on it, but not at all. They’re on there really well so you don’t have to worry about them falling off easily. And I’ve gotten so many compliments on it because it is just so different than your typical headband. The best part is that there are so many colors in the jewels that it will go with many different outfits. I can’t say enough good things about this headband.",B0895XPZNT,1613327373303,5.0

Although the headband isn’t covered in actual crystals, the little plastic beads give off a little iridescent sparkle when hit by the sun. It’s quite fetching! And the color is a really nice neutral pink.",B08HQSK576,1612134813733,5.0
AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Game Changer!,I was a little nervous about using magnetic eyelashes for the first time. But these are actually very easy to use and stick well to the eyeliner as long as you do two coats. I love the fact that you have three pair of more natural looking lashes and two pair of more dramatic for evenings out. I did have to trim mine a little but I hear that’s normal for most people. I love the fact that I can have gorgeous lashes again now that I’m in my 50s. I wear these to work every day.,B086GST51S,1610074908720,5.0
AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Does a great job,I felt a little like Silence of the Lambs wearing this mask but I must say it really does a great job keeping the moisturizer on your face.

AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Super comfy,I Purchased this pillow because I have a bathtub from 1960 and it’s very uncomfortable. I’ve used the little blowup plastic pillows in the past but they just don’t quite do the trick. I thought I would try something a little bit larger that doesn’t need to be blown up and I’m extremely happy I did. What’s nice about this is that you can throw it in the washing machine every once in a while to get it really clean. Love these!,B088ZVSLYP,1603655894543,5.0
AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,A headband for every outfit!,I have a headband collection because I hate having bangs in my face when it’s warm.

AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Pretty tube and goes on nicely,I love anything peacock and so this caught my attention because of the packaging. But it’s actually a very good mascara that goes on nicely without clumping. The brush is on the thinner side but that makes it especially useful when doing your lower lashes. I was very impressed with the packaging which went beyond my expectations. I really like this mascara!,B086SSHLWT,1596341211575,5.0
AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Mascara and curler in one!,"What a great deal to get an eyelash curler along with your mascara, and they match in red also! This mascara goes on nicely and doesn’t clump.

AEV4UO43YIZXLNB4E64KWRJ3ACXQ,Great for my body products biz,I was looking for something that was pretty but still economical to offer custom fragrances to my customers.

AEBWGXGGL3Q5DSTMUQSTVUJDWSMA,Sweet with spicy-must,"This perfume is most definitely sweet with a spicy-musty scent.<br />You've got the freshness of citrus but also something grounding and a little spicy. On my skin the longevity & sillage is moderate, I feel it fades after just a few hours.",B0BTJ6SYKB,1622823883780,4.0
AEBWGXGGL3Q5DSTMUQSTVUJDWSMA,Gently works!,"So many nail polish removers either smell awful or leave my nails brittle and weak, but not this! The scent is one of the best I've smelled from a polish remover! This stuff is gentle on my nails and works!",B08NC4378M,1619187660447,5.0
AEBWGXGGL3Q5DSTMUQSTVUJDWSMA,Great for unwanted yellow tones!,"I've been getting my hair highlighted for longer than I can remember and due to my natural color, my hair tends to pull strong yellow and subtle orange tones about 2 weeks after getting it done. I've tried lot's of purple shampoos and they are not treated the same. Most of them would either dry my hair out or by doing the opposite and weighing my fine hair down, this duo is balanced!<br />I use this shampoo twice a week and it does a perfect job on keeping my cool blonde.<br />After using it my hair feels noticeably hydrated and not dry. It also doesn't stain my hair purple like many, but gently lightens and brightens my blonde hair!<br />This shampoo boosts its undertones as well as preventing fade and ramping up shine.",B08GMC48QF,1612047959088,5.0
AEBWGXGGL3Q5DSTMUQSTVUJDWSMA,Elegant yet flirty,I love how rich and complex this wears and I like the scent better once on my skin than it smells beforehand.<br />I think it's a great evening fragrance or for someone who's looking for something with a little more pop!,B0B2L218H2,1606143534865,4.0
AEBWGXGGL3Q5DSTMUQSTVUJDWSMA,Uniquely enchanting,These three notes truly create an enchanting effect!<br />It's scent reminds me of a sweet spiked cocoa that goes on decently strong smelling but in fact is extremely subtle once it settles.

AEBWGXGGL3Q5DSTMUQSTVUJDWSMA,Smooth sensual aromas,"I'll start off by saying the bottle is absolutely gorgeous. Its full of golden sparkles!<br />This fragrance has smooth, sensual smell with aromas of jasmine, vanilla and soft musk. <br />The combination lends itself to a fresh, sweet smell at first that's later followed by a warm, musky base.<br />I normally wear jadore so this perfume is an affordable twist to switch it up.",B0BTJ6SYKB,1595869470525,5.0
AEBWGXGGL3Q5DSTMUQSTVUJDWSMA,Lightweight and quick absorbent,"A little goes along way!<br />This is a very lightweight moisturizer that absorbs quickly without any residue which is a plus. The scent is very subtle and not overbearing.<br />If you have really dry skin, it would not be the go-to product but works perfectly if you just need a little moisture refresher. While ots not the best lotion I've used, I'm pleased thus far.",B07SW7D6ZR,1580930054898,4.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Lightweight firming oil,"I really like this brand. This is another product from Beauty Stat that I'm impressed with. I really enjoy using this oil. It's lightweight, not greasy, and doesn't leave my skin shiny. It absorbs so nicely. My skin is left feeling very soft and firm. I love the ingredients. It's definently been a great addition to my skin regimen. I recommend trying it.",B08RRSPNWV,1619877469484,5.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Pleasantly surprised!,"I have used this de-stressing cream both am and pm. I usually don't use something like this during the day bc I try to keep my products to a minimum. For this reviews sake I used this during the day under my makeup and it looked good. Now I use this at night. We expose our skin to alot of stresses in the environment and at night our skin rejuvenates. So I feel this is great to use while I sleep. This jar may seem small but a little goes a long way so it should last some time. It's not greasy, spreads across my face easily, and it absorbs well. It's very hydrating and it doesn't leave a shine on your face. I do use this sometimes during the day if I'm not wearing any makeup. (Like I said it looked good under makeup, I just don't use a separate moisturizer on makeup days I use a few other products and it'd be too much) Anyway when I wake up in the morning my skin really feels good. It's soft, smooth, and supple. It even has a bit more bounce back of you know what I mean. I'm impressed with this cream. It's fragrance free and doesn't irritate my skin which can be mildly sensitive. So I definitely can say I recommend it.",B07W1WJZFG,1611923457790,4.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,"Little quantity, high price point","This is a decent mask, but I didn't find it to be anything special. I have better masks that I'll reach for over this. The ingredients seem very nice. It does give my face a nice glow. The price point is ridiculous for the amount of product. If the mask was either the most amazing mask I've ever tried, you recieved more quantity for the price, or it was alot cheaper in price. Then I'd say go for it, but as it is I really don't recommend spending the money. There are alot better masks out there including here on Amazon.",B07PCGSFGQ,1605569197325,3.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,"Very giftable, Great sheet masks",I've tried a couple sheet masks from Karuna before and really liked them. So when I saw this I really wanted to try it. It's a great easy to try a few of their sheet masks. They come in a nice box that opens and closes. Very giftable! Karuna sheet masks are so good I really see results. You recieve seven masks one of which is a pack of undereye patches. I'm really happy with theses. Plus they look lovely on my vanity.,B08GYJY8F2,1604837032995,5.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Lived up to its claims,"I always start out telling the readers that I'm a skincare addict. I love a good sheet mask. What I mean by a ""good"" sheetmask  is one that shows results after use. I've tried another sheet mask from Karuna and I wasn't too impressed. I decided to give these a try because I love a brightening mask that claims to make my skin glow. Well I ended up pretty impressed. I recieved 3 masks in a box.  I immediately saw results. My face looked bright and clear. It was very hydrating and felt cool and relaxing. Definitely great for pampering oneself. The mask is thin and biodegradable. It's filled with serum. It actually drips off the chin area. I just use that for my neck. The serum doesn't leave a film on my skin like many do. With clean hands I removed the mask after 20 minutes and massaged the serum into my skin. I also like to use my facial roller to help my skin absorb the serum. The Oh, glow on sheet masks are very good. I recommend them as part of your skincare routine.",B08BS3WDPJ,1600089030848,5.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Moisturizing & Sanitizing Not greasy!,"I admit I'm a germaphobe. I always have to have some type of hand sanitizer on hand within reach. So of coarse my hands are usually dry from hand washing and sanitizing. Especially during this pandemic. I was very interested to try this and see if it lives up to its claims. It's looks and feels like a cross between lotion and hand soap. You can smell the alcohol a little bit (but I like that). This for me it's a good thing because I know it's really sanitizing my hands. It also has a nice subtle scent. This doesn't leave my hands greasy at all, which was a concern of mine. It moisturizes my hands. It does not leave any kind of film on my skin (don't use too much) which ends up picking up dirt and kinds of yucky things. (Example: after applying a greasy lotion on your hands it causes your hands to be quite dirty) My hands feel soft, not greasy, and sanitized. I think it's worth the price and it's the perfect size to easily carry in my purse. I highly recommend giving this a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",B087J3H22J,1599571949451,4.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Absolutely Amazing!,"I think I've fallen in love with Dr. Denese products.  When I saw the words ""essential lipid power"" I had to try this. I do use her whipped moisturizer with lipids a few nights a week so I figure this serum would do wonders for my skin. I was right! I follow the directions and apply a few drops on my freshly cleansed skin prior to any other products. It makes my skin feel amazingly soft. I have no trouble applying my other serums after this. I wait until this serum absorbs.  My skin has been looking so healthy. It has a new youthful bounce to it. This serum is already amazing. With continued use (which I plan on) I'm sure I'll see more results. I highly recommend this product.",B07DFNPVSF,1598014057563,5.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,"Irritated, redness, inflamed","I gave this three stars a neutral rating rather than good or bad. Let me explain why. I was very interested in this product since I always use vitamin C in my regimen I'm always checking out different brands. Plus this one is also a revitalizing oil and I love products that brighten the skin. It's also a cruelty free product. It's a small bottle as you can see from my photo. Has a small dropper which is perfect since you only need a little bit. Now this product directs you to use this first after cleansing your skin before any other serums or creams. It directs 2-6 drops I recommend 2-3 or it'll be too oily. I still had a little trouble when applying my hyaluronic acid. (The drops are small). It has an awful smell that I can't place, but it's familiar from some other skincare products. This smell does go away thankfully. This product claims that your skin will feel light and refreshed. Mine didn't feel that. My skin felt nice to the touch but it felt very irritated and it was inflamed. It caused my skin to become very red (mean while I'm always trying to get rid of redness). I thought about cleaning my face off and starting over without this oil, but it was too late it was absorbed. My skin was left feeling very uncomfortable, irritated, and red. Fortunately I tried this on a day when I was just going to chill at home. I ended up applying a moisturizer that calms skin, reduces redness, and is great for sensitive skin. It helped very little with this particular issue but it usually does help. Please keep in mind that my skin is not really sensitive. Very few products have ever irritated it. I ended up very concerned about a breakout which I never get. This product is sadly not for me at all! So I gave this a neutral rating instead of a lower rating because it may work nicely for someone else. Thus far this has been my experience with this product. I really wanted to love it. Please take my entire review into account when deciding whether or not to purchase this. I personally cannot recommend this product. Especially to anyone with any skin sensitivity. I hope my review has been helpful.",B08BZ1RHPS,1597578588953,3.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Leaves my skin feeling amazing!,"I've tried quite a few products from this brand and I've been happy with them all. So when I had the chance to try this product I was excited. It's a nice gentle exfoliant. It has a bunch of small grinds in it. It's easy to rinse off. It's good for sensitive skin. It does a really great job cleaning and exfoliating my skin. I love the way my skin feels afterwards. It feels very smooth. I do think it's a bit overpriced though, but it definitely does its job! I just recieved this recently and it expires in two months. It was the same with a few of their other products.",B07MMW5654,1596464181542,5.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Very nice gentle product,"I've tried a few products from this brand and I've really liked them. Unfortunately this one and one other product I received expire in less than two months from when I recieved them. I have pretty nice skin because I take very good care of it. So for me 0.5% retinol is just right. It doesn't irritate my skin or dry it out which is always a concern of mine when I use any type of retinol product. This is a nice serum consistency. My skin looks healthier and brighter. It didn't cause me any redness, which can be a problem for me, nor did it cause any irritation. I recommend giving this a try along with some of their other products. Just keep in mind when ordering that a couple of products I recieved to review were very close to expiration.",B07MN1KJ15,1595716571757,4.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,I REALLY enjoy this cleanser!,"This is a nice gentle cleanser. It's in gel form, reminds me of a thicker version of aloe vera. Although it's gentle on my semi sensitive skin it really gets the job done. Leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling dry and tight. I love the way my skin feels after I use it. Soft, healthy, and smooth. I feel like my skin glows. It is a bit pricey but it does a great job. After reading the directions I was a little confused<br />It says ""apply through dampened fingers"" is my face supposed to be wet? Well I  did lightly wet my face before applying along with my fingers. As I added water it lathered up and felt great. It's nice and gentle, there was no redness after use. I hoped this helped. I do recommend trying this cleanser.",B07ZQRX7FX,1594715443502,4.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Really cleans out pores,This is a wonderful clay mask. It's a little thick coming out but it's very easy to spread. Has a nice subtle sweet scent. You'll feel the mask warm up a bit when it begins to work. So don't think you're having a reaction it's just how it works. You can actually start seeing speckles in the areas where the pores have been cleaned out. It was so easy to remove. I used a warm wet cloth and easily wiped it off. My skin was so smooth and so fresh looking. My pores were so clean and clear. They appeared smaller and tighter. I'm really happy with this mask. Now if you look at the photo I uploaded you'll see the expiration date is 9/20 which is only two months away. The directions recommend using once to twice a week. There's no way I'll finish this before it expires. (Just a side note: I also recieved a retinoid cream from the same brand with the same expression date) and I just recieved these products. Just keep that in mind when purchasing. Product wise though is a definite 5 stars!,B07M9D3WYW,1593822367461,5.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Works great!,I always double cleanse. I first start with either a makeup wipe or micellar water. Then I go in with this. In the past I've tried Farmacy green clean and Pixie's balm cleanser (which is very good). I admit I was skeptical since I hadn't heard of it. I was pleasantly surprised! It gets all the makeup residue off my skin.  It has a subtle rose 8scent. If scents bother you it goes away and it its very subtle. I love it. If you're into Korean skincare or are getting into it I recommend trying this.,B07PHWX88W,1586076772113,5.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Very nice,I've been using this for about 10 days now. I don't know what if anything it's doing long term yet. So far though I'm enjoying this serum. It has fantastic ingredients. Grape seed has excellent anti aging benefits. This serum is hydrating and works well under makeup. It hasn't irritated my skin which can be sensitive.,B07WNBZQGT,1581992104379,4.0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,Amazingly soft skin,I'm a big fan of argan oil and have tried quite a few. I love this big 4 oz bottle because I like to use it on my body. This one is not as thick as other brands I've tried. I've used it mixed with lotion like I've used others but this one spreads easier and absorbs quicker. It leaves my skin like silk. I have dry skin all year round but winter it's the worst. This has helped it dramatically. The best is I can use this one by itself and it doesn't leave my skin too oily. It just feels amazing! I will definitely purchase this when I run out.,B081632HX6,1579320083415,5.0
AEC6IZVI2NGFBCIYVD4X5MDGB6DQ_2,So Much More than Just an Air Freshener,"I never in my life would have thought I'd consider an air freshener as a giftable item, except perhaps as a gag gift to one of my brothers. This Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener, however, is in a class all by itself. Even the box it comes in is beautiful, with soft sweeping white and beige brush strokes in the background and beautiful flowers embossed in gold. The pattern wraps all the way around the box, with each side being different. The inside of the box is a vivid lime green. The spray bottle for the air freshener looks more like a perfume bottle, light and dark pink with more of the gold embossing, this time with leaves instead of flowers. The key ingredients of this air freshener are water, hibiscus oil, and hydrogenated castor oil. The bottle contains 3.38 fl oz (100 ml). The directions say to wash linens and clothes before spraying this linen mist on them. It says this spray can be used on sheets, furniture fabric, drapes, pillows, and directly in the room as an air freshener. It also says to shake the bottle well before using it. When sprayed, the hibiscus scent is very subtle and faint, but definitely there. My wife had me spray some on the blouse she was wearing so that she could enjoy the hibiscus scent all day long, and she plans to spray her pillow before she goes to sleep. For a soft, gentle hibiscus aroma that stays pleasantly in the background without overwhelming my senses, this Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener works well.",B08T7GPT1D,1624496395044,5.0
AEC6IZVI2NGFBCIYVD4X5MDGB6DQ_2,"Not Just a Name, The Shampoo and Conditioner Really Are Purple","I got this shampoo and conditioner for my wife--here is her review: I wanted this shampoo and conditioner because it said it worked really well for gray and white hair--as a senior I have plenty of both--and because it got good reviews re fragrance and how soft it left hair. When I was in the shower and squirted some shampoo into my hand, I was amazed to see that the shampoo really is a dark purple color. I asked myself if I could live with it if it actually turned my hair purple, decided I could, and lathered up. The shampoo did an excellent job of creating a strong lather, and my hair felt really clean when I rinsed it out. The shampoo has a soft floral fragrance that is very pleasant. I took a quick look in the mirror to see if my hair was purple, and it wasn't, so I then squirted out some conditioner into my hand. It was purple, too, although thicker and lighter in color than the shampoo. As I rubbed the conditioner into my hair, the wonderful floral scent of the conditioner filled my shower--what a delightful sensory treat! I checked my hair again when I got out of the shower and dried off--still no purple hair, thank goodness. However, when I squirted some shampoo into my hand to take a photo, there was a big purple stain on my hand when I washed the shampoo off. I squirted the conditioner in a different spot on my hand for that photo, and it did the same thing. I've washed my hands several times since then, and the purple stains are still there. So...even though the product information online says it works fine with gray and white hair, I look down at my purple stains on my hand and I have to wonder. Since I love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and how incredibly soft it leaves my hair, I'm going to continue using it. If it turns my hair purple at some point in the future, I'll do an update and give everyone fair warning.",B08RY6S25W,1621305207644,5.0
AEC6IZVI2NGFBCIYVD4X5MDGB6DQ_2,IMHO Not Fragrant and They're Tiny,"The pictures of these ""petal balls"" on the web page are bigger than the actual balls.  I was kind of expecting the opposite.  I followed the directions and put one of the balls in a dish and poured boiling water over it.  It was kind of fun to watch it re-hydrate but that was about the end of the enjoyment.  The ""fragrance"" given off by these petal balls was akin to a weak tea although I surely wouldn't drink it.  As for putting one in a tub, I suspect the ""bloom"" would clog up the drain and just create a mess.  Plus I don't want to take a bath in a pot of tea.  I'll have to pass on this one.",B08KT7FCYY,1609894098254,3.0

The case looks good and is secured by a snap connector.  There are individual slide-in holders for each pair of tweezers and the scissors.  There isn't a slot for the brush but I just put it in with one of the tweezers.  The quality of the tweezers is outstanding.  They appear to be very well machined and they passed my ""grab a hair"" test.  What I do is try to grad a single fine hair off of my arm.  If the tweezers get it in one try and can hold on to it to pull it out, they pass.  Each pair of tweezers passed the test.  Another thing I like is that this set doesn't have a bunch of needless junk in it that just takes up room.  This set can fit in my shaving kit without taking up extra space.

Not a problem as it didn't cause any ""rings"" on the tub and I came out with skin the same color as when I went in, minus some dirt.  I'll be buying some as Christmas gifts.

I don't know if this is because of how they were packaged, (which was a very secure packaging), that caused some of them to widen.  This is a problem for me beauty I already have issues with headbands sliding back with my egg/oval-shaped head, so a wide headband will most certainly slide off.<br />Aside from these two minor issues, the headbands are great.

It is creamy and does not leave my lips dry.<br />I ordered Maple Road and I like the color; the description appears to be pretty accurate. Comparing my picture to the one on the listing, I think it is close to the ""one coat"" shade. It has like a faded look to it, hence the matte style. I do think it's closest to a red-orange with a brown tint to it as opposed to a red tint. I wore it for about eight hours and it lasted the entire time. I like this lipstick and I would like to order Chilly Jilly but I think the price is on the high side for this lipstick, so I will probably pass on it.",B08BY91SGT,1600322553672,4.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Exactly what I needed to make picking up rhinestones/gems/sequins/etc. easy!,"These are great! They feel nice to hold. Not flimsy. They’re comfortable in the hand. Plus, they have a cute look to them!<br /><br />They are dual ended. You have the wax tip that picks up rhinestones/gems or any other nail art like sequins or charms. Then there is a stainless steel tip that you use to press down the rhinestone/gem/etc. to keep them in place. You can also pick up a little rhinestone glue with the stainless steel tip and use it to apply a small dot of glue to where you want it on the nail. It’s so helpful!<br /><br />I needed something to help me pick up rhinestones, gems, sequins, charms, etc. When I tried to use one of those pencils to pick up rhinestones, it worked but not every time, so I’d have to fuss around with it. Using tweezers worked, but it’s hard to not have the rhinestones/gems slip through them and sequins are so thin it’s hard to pick up just one. I tried using a little brush to pick up sequins and things like that, which worked, but sometimes I’d only get 1 or 2, sometimes I’d get a ton that were overlapping. So nothing seemed to work right and be totally easy to use. Until these! I really have no complaints!<br /><br />Overall, I definitely recommend these if you do a lot of nail rhinestones/gems or art using sequins/charms/etc. It’s totally worth it to help with the ease of application and save you time and frustration trying to use something else. If you don’t do a lot of nail art using stuff like rhinestones/gems/sequins/charms/etc., then it might be fine just using something you probably already have like tweezers or a brush. But, if you were going to buy one of those pencils that pick up rhinestones/gems, I say skip that and go for these! They work so much better and you get 2 of them!",B093H28PD4,1631278746134,5.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"Very cute, little dishes that can be used as dappen dishes or for other things!","These are so cute! First, they’re heart shaped. Second, the glass has a rainbow look to it. Third, they’re small and most small things are cute!<br /><br />They have a kind of felt on the bottom, which can keep it from scratching a surface if it slides, which is nice. But, it also means it slides easily. These are meant to be dappen dishes, so they are supposed to be used for liquids you’d use when doing your nails, such as slip solution, polish, etc. I found it had a habit of slipping easily when I dipped a brush in and wasn’t being careful about it (like if I dipped in and kind of hit the side). As long as I gently dipped into the dish, I didn’t have issues with it sliding, and even when it did slide it wasn’t a big deal because it’s not like it slid all the way across the table. Just something to be aware of.<br /><br />The lids are clear, which I thought was interesting. I’m not sure why they don’t have the rainbow look like the bottom, but it doesn’t look bad with the clear lids. I love that these came with lids that actually fit. I previously saw dappen dishes I wanted, but they had these huge lids that just kind of sat on top of the dishes, so I didn’t get them. These lids actually fit the bottoms so I’m happy about that!<br /><br />Even though these are meant to be dappen dishes, they can be used for many other things you might need a little container for. They’re very small, so there aren’t a ton of uses I can think of. But, they’d work for any kind of liquid or small items you’d want to put in them (like on your dresser to put your earrings and rings in when you take them off at the end of the night).<br /><br />I think these are great dishes. The glass is thick and durable. They look beautiful. They’re cute. And you get 2 of them! I recommend!",B08R3F946X,1626468234060,5.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"Thought this was amazing, but now only like it..read UPDATE at bottom of review","I’d been using the Sol De Janeiro Bum Bum Body Scrub. I looooove that scrub. It smells AMAZING and the smell stays with you. You know how most body scrubs smell nice but as soon as you’re done using it, you can’t really smell it on you? Well, the Bum Bum Body Scrub isn’t like that! You can smell it on you after, heck, my whole apartment smells like coconut after using it! BUUUUT it’s $42 and it’s a sugar scrub so it goes FAST. I also hate the container it comes in. It’s cute, but it’s a pain to open in the shower, get your hand in there and get some scrub out, and it dissolves pretty quick as water hits it since it’s a sugar scrub. So, I wanted a sugar scrub that was more affordable, but still smelled great, that wasn’t such a pain to get out in the shower, and that possibly didn’t dissolve so quick when water hit it. THIS SCRUB CHECKS ALL THOSE BOXES!<br /><br />It’s way more affordable than the Bum Bum scrub. It comes in a jar, so you have to screw the top off, similar to the Bum Bum scrub. But, a lot easier. It smells amazing, like vanilla. It isn’t as strong smelling as the Bum Bum scrub, but I still feel like I can smell it on me after my shower. The BEST part....this is a “Sugar Balm Body Scrub.” The balm makes it kind of like a thicker, kind of paste. It is easier to pick up with your hands, spread on your body, and it doesn’t dissolve anywhere close to as quick as most sugar scrubs.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this scrub! I will definitely replace it when I run out, and definitely recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE - The first few times I used this, I don’t know how I didn’t notice. But, when I was using it again, I saw a loose hair from my head on my arm, I went to pick it up and as I did, my nails kind of scraped against my skin. I felt gunk go under my nails. I looked and saw all this gunk under the 2 nails that scraped against my skin! I was like, “WHAT THE HECK?!” So, then I took my nails and scraped against another area I’d used the scrub at and the same thing happened. I remembered people saying this left a film on their skin, which at the time I initially wrote my review I didn’t feel it did. But, now I DEFINITELY say it does. BUT, it can be washed off. After I scraped my skin and found out about the gunk, I took a regular body wash on a wash cloth and went over the areas I’d used the scrub. After that I scraped my nails over the areas again and, thankfully, no gunk. So, you can get the residue off. Now, whether or not you want to go through scrubbing your body with this scrub and then go over it again with soap or body wash, that’s up to you. For me, it’s not a big deal because I like how this is a balm that doesn’t rinse away as quickly as a regular sugar scrub does. I like that I can spread it onto my body and then scrub without worrying about it melting away as soon as it touches my skin. So, I’m okay dealing with having to go over the areas with a body wash after using it. But, I’m definitely going to keep searching to find the perfect body sugar scrub that is affordable and doesn’t melt away quickly like this one, but that doesn’t leave a film I have to wash off after using it. So, I’m dropping my rating down from a 5 to a 3. I thought about only dropping it to a 4 since I still like it and am willing to deal with having to go over and wash again where I used it. But, it is still kind of a pain to have to do, so I decided to drop it to a 3.",B07FPS2VFK,1624403602502,3.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,So far so good...,"So far I really enjoy this! The EGF is at the bottom of the ingredient list so there isn’t a lot in it, which I’m okay with. It’s my first product with EGF in it and I read that EGF can be harsh on the skin. I don’t have sensitive skin but did get slightly red when using this. I’ve been using it every other night. It moisturizes my face well. I haven’t noticed any other benefits so far. If you’re looking for something with a high amount of EGF, this isn’t for you since it’s so far down on the ingredient list. But, if like me, you’re looking for something with some EGF in it to get you started but not be too much, this is a good one to start with!",B01N7A5AGF,1617470212597,4.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"Small Jar, But Very Moisturizing!","This comes in an outer product box. The bottom of the jar is made of thick glass that is frosted, the top is thick, white plastic. It has a nice appearance. There’s a plastic safety seal, which I always like. The cream is white. It has a thick consistency, but just glides onto the skin and melts into the skin. It doesn’t feel heavy on my skin. It actually does t feel like anything on the skin...it just feels like you have really moisturized skin without anything on. It absorbs quickly, it doesn’t leave any residue or sticky feeling. The cream does have a scent, like citrus, but it isn’t too over powering and is a nice smell.<br /><br />The cream feels nice on the skin. I feel really moisturized after applying it. My skin feels nice and soft. Whenever I’ve applied this at night, the next morning my skin still feels moisturized. I have dry skin, some really dry areas, so I love anything that can make my skin feel moisturized and keep it feeling that way for a while! It works nicely under makeup too. I wouldn’t use it under my makeup all the time, but on days when I’m extra dry, this works perfect! A little goes a long way, which is good since the jar is so small!<br /><br />I haven’t noticed any help with brightening or anything, but I am hopeful! The only thing I don’t like is it’s a pretty small jar for the price. But, a little goes a long way and with so many great ingredients and how moisturizing it feels, I would consider paying that. But, I can’t say for sure if I would just yet. So, I’ll update the review once I’ve used this for longer. So far, I definitely recommend this if price isn’t a factor! It has great ingredients, I love the way it feels on my skin.",B08P7PSMRR,1616483170806,4.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Great Starter Set!,"This comes packaged together in a cute purple box.<br /><br />There’s 8 tubes of poly gel. Each tube is sealed. There’s a nice sized pink nail file. There’s a dual headed tool - one end has the flat metal side to apply the poly gel. The other side is a brush. There’s a bottle of base coat and a bottle of top coat. There’s also a bag of dual forms.<br /><br />This has everything you need EXCEPT for slip solution, which you can just use alcohol so that’s not a huge deal. The product info page says, “you can use alcohol ,cleanser or base coat to instead, They act the same effect.).” Also, one of the photos on the product page says, “Base coat could be used as a slip solution. It will make it easier to make gel smoothly. No alcohol or nail cleanser needed!” I’ve never heard of using cleanser (what cleanser do they mean? 🤷‍♀️) or base coat as a slip solution. But I’m pretty new to poly gels, so I could just not know. Unless it’s just this brands base coat that can be used as a slip solution? 🤷‍♀️<br /><br />There’s a good assortment of colors. You get “clear,” “nude,” “pink,” “orange red,” “bean paste” (I’m not sure why the product info page calls it that but it’s like a pinky mauve type color to me), “brown” (this is like a light tan color), and 2 “color changing” (one looks like it goes from a hot pink or purplish pink to white and the other looks like it goes from a pinky red to a white).<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great set. There’s a good assortment of colors. The poly gels work well. You get everything you need (EXCEPT the slip solution).

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"It’s Okay, But Not For Me...","This is okay but there’s a few issues I have with it....<br /><br />First, the mirror came with a little chunk in the corner gone. It’s not a big deal because it’s so small, but it would be nice if the mirror would have come better protected so that it wasn’t missing a piece no matter how small.<br /><br />Second, this doesn’t really hold much unless you want it to be all separate parts. If you have it all put together with the side trays sitting on each side of the big oval tray, the silicone pieces over top the side trays, and the square tray sitting in the middle of the big oval tray - Then you can’t hold much with it. The side trays with the silicone pieces only hold so much. The one with the lines you can lay brushes in the grooves like shown in the photos on the product page. But, there’s only 4 grooves where brushes can actually lay, and more than 1 or sometimes 2 brushes is all that fits in each groove. The other silicone tray has the X’s that you can put things in so they stand straight up. There’s 11 small ones and 8 big ones. The big ones you could potentially fit more than 1 item in. Also, the middle tray part that the mirror goes over as a lid, if you’re going to do that, then you can only have items in that tray that the mirror will be able to lay flat over, so that limits how much and what you can place in it. If you have it all put together, then it doesn’t take up much room. But, if you have it all in separate parts (like the first photo on the product page), then it takes up a lot of room for not holding too much. I might as well keep using my cups or brush holders for my brushes, which hold a ton of brushes, and plastic or acrylic drawer organizers.<br /><br />Third, I don’t like how the mirror just sits, it isn’t actually attached. It comes off so easy. One little bump and the mirror falls over. It would be nice if they would have that attached somehow so that it would fold down over the tray but still be connected.<br /><br />Finally, it’s supposed to be easy to wash and dry. To me, the silicone pieces are not easy to clean. The dust collects on them like crazy. And I try to just wipe off the dust with a dry cloth but the silicone is rubbery and the dust just kind of sticks to it. If you use a wet cloth you’re able to get the dust, but you have to work really hard to get it off. I just don’t like it.<br /><br />Overall, this just doesn’t work for me. I wanted it to organize things while taking up less space. But, when it is taking up less space, it doesn’t hold enough for me. If you’re looking just to hold a few small things. Like you have some small items that you just want to have a place, then this might work for you. As long as you don’t mind that the mirror isn’t attached and might come off easy.",B08LZ6W8RF,1612370091319,3.0

So, unfortunately I wasn’t able to actually use this since it was just too darn big! It seems like it is a standard jar exerciser. It seems durable.

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"Not Creamy, Not Pigmented...","This comes in a cute outer product box. Inside, the pencil is wrapped in plastic.<br /><br />The pencil is a standard jumbo kind of pencil and has a clear lid. I show a photo comparing it to a pen to show size.<br /><br />I got the shade “Chalfont - 303,” which is described as a “shimmering shade of Pearl.” For me, this just wasn’t great. For me, I just think it’s definitely not worth $18 (at the time of writing this review).<br /><br />The product info page describes the pencil as having “intense colour.” I did not notice any intensity of color! It says, “Use your makeup highlighter pencil as a creamy, velvety eyeshadow, eyeliner, and highlighter. Apply it to your inner corners and entire eyelid for a pop of intense colour.” This pencil wasn’t creamy or velvety. To me it felt really dry and was even kind of powdery on application. It also says, “It can be used on its own with a beautiful opaque colour payoff, or built up for extra glamour thanks to its vibrant pigment.” It didn’t seem opaque at all. It could be because I got a shimmer Pearl shade. But, when I applied it, you could hardly see it, I had to really layer it, and even then it’s just not very noticeable.<br /><br />I’ve tried other Pippa of London products and they’ve been great. Unfortunately, this pencil wasn’t one of them. This was a no for me. It could have been the color, maybe if I would have gotten a darker color it would have performed as the product page describes.

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Beautiful Glitters!,"These come together in a nice box that flips open at the top. There’s styrofoam at the top protecting the bottles. There’s an instruction booklet inside. There’s styrofoam holding each of the bottles in place inside, which I liked a lot! There’s stickers on the top of each colored polish. The stickers are the color of the polish and have numbers on them (like P037 and P038). I really liked they had stickers on the TOPS of the bottles so you can easily see which color the polish is. The bottles are all made of glass. They feel nice. And they are decent sizes.<br /><br />There are NO base or top coats included. This is ONLY colored polishes. So, if you don’t have a top and base coat, you’ll need to get your own to use this set.<br /><br />I got the chameleon shimmering color and black. Theres 6 polishes in total. There’s 5 glitter polishes - a lime green, a blue (the sticker is a little misleading, it makes it look like it’s a baby blue, but really it’s a royal blue), purple (again, the sticker is a little misleading, it looks like a pink, but the color is a purple), another purple, and a dark blue (again, the sticker is misleading, it looks like it’s a silver, but it’s a dark blue). There’s 1 solid color - a black.<br /><br />Even the photos on the product page can be a little misleading. On the product page the first photo shows a dark teal glitter, a dark blue glitter, a dark green glitter, a dark purple glitter, a blue glitter and then the solid black. But those are what the shades are supposed to look like with a black base. If you look at the other product photos, especially the 3rd one, you’ll see what the colors are without a black base and with a black base. All the shades look the same in the bottle as what’s shown in the 3rd product photo without a black base, EXCEPT “P041.” In the 3rd product photo “P041” without a black base looks like a silver glitter, just like the sticker on top of the bottle makes it seem. But, in the bottle and on the finger (without a black base), it looks like a dark blue glitter.<br /><br />These are glitters so they are a little thick, but they’re still easy to work with. They cure easily. They look beautiful with or without the black base. I love that I basically get 10 colors because I get 5 colors when I use a black base, and then 5 slightly different colors if I use the black base.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a cute set if you’re looking for glitter polishes!",B085SY4WC3,1611724045464,5.0

I always appreciate when a product has a standard plug!<br /><br />The shiny gold appearance of it is a little gaudy for my taste. But, I hadn’t seen an at home nail lamp with this high of wattage before, so I was willing to have the shiny gold if I got the high wattage.

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Feel Soft and Creamy! Not too Pigmented But Do Build Up Well!,"These come in an outer product box that is sealed in clear plastic wrapping. Once you remove the plastic wrapping, the product box has an open window in the front where you can see the eyeshadow shadow sticks (see photos). The back of the box lists the ingredients be the manufacturer (in China). It also has the cruelty free bunny logo. (See photos)<br /><br />The eyeshadow sticks are all in black tubes. They have the brand name “Luxaza” along with the name of the shade on the front written in the shade of the shadow stick. There’s black lids on one end and a clear lid on the other end. Under the clear lid, there’s a brush. Now...it was really weird with the brush end. First, I went to pull off the clear cap, and it wouldn’t pull off. So I thought maybe it was screw off, so when I tried to twist it, I heard the clicking sound like the crayon part was twisting out, which I didn’t want since I still had the cap on that end. I then pulled really hard and the clear cap came off. Then, I brushed my finger across the tip of the brush to feel it, and it looked like a bunch of powder came flying off of it. So I thought maybe I missed somewhere where it said the other end of the shadow stick had a powder brush. So, I went to the product page to see and it doesn’t say anything about powder. It was just what I initially thought, that it’s a brush to blend out the shadow stick. So, I brushed my finger across the tip of the brush again to see if more powder came off and none did. So, I then took the clear cap off another shadow stick and brushed my finger across the tip of that brush to see if powder would come off...none did. Then I went through doing that with all the other shadow sticks and no powder type stuff came off of those. So I don’t know what it was with that first one...or if I’m just crazy which is entirely possible too 😂 Anyways, the brush feels nice and soft. It’s short and dense, but still a little fluffy, so blends out color well. Like I said, the clear cap is a little tough to remove...I really had to pull to get it off each shadow stick. Also, you need to be careful when putting the cap back on because the hairs of the brush get in the way.<br /><br />The crayon part you don’t need to sharpen. It twists up. You twist the end with the brush. There’s not too much product in the tube. I twisted them all the way up to see. It ends up looking to be less than half the size of the tube (see photos, I took a photo of one twisted all the way up). They do feel smooth and creamy. They aren’t very pigmented. To get the pigment you see in my swatches, I needed to go over them each quite a few times (about 5 times). Most are shimmers. 2 of them have glitter particles in them (“Mermaid Teardrop” and “Purple Sunset”). The glitter isn’t too bad, it doesn’t fall out and leave glitter particles everywhere. But, like any glitter, when you try to remove it, you will see glitter particles randomly afterwards (anyone who have used anything with any glitter in it knows what I mean....it’s just everywhere! 😂).  I do think that a few of the colors are so similar you don’t notice a difference on the eyes. Especially “Dark Orchid” and “Dark Magenta.” I just don’t notice much difference between them. The brush on the other end blends them out well. They last okay on my eyes. I have really hooded eyes, so any type of cream shadow usually creases and wears off within a few hours. These were no different when I used them on their own. But, if I used them together with powder eyeshadow, they lasted well.<br /><br />Overall, you get 6 shadow sticks for $9.99 (at the time of writing this review). If these are colors you like and you want just a wash of color, I’d say go for it! They are smooth and creamy. If you’re looking for something with really good pigment, you’re going to have to really build these up for good pigment. Since there’s other cream stick shadows out there that are much more pigmented without needing to build them up, I wouldn’t really recommend these if you want something with a lot of pigment without needing built up.",B08MPK4JRB,1608823986030,4.0

The product itself is white, a medium consistency cream feel.<br /><br />It’s very gentle. It doesn’t lather up at all. You just move the product around on your face to get off any makeup or whatever. I always double cleanse, but if I didn’t, this isn’t something I’d use to remove makeup. This is something I’d use in my double cleanse - I use a makeup removing oil to remove my makeup, rinse that off, and then use this cleanser. This is marketed for people with sensitive skin, and I would definitely say it’s very gentle. I’m not saying this wouldn’t clean off makeup, but personally since it doesn’t lather up, I just wouldn’t feel like my face is totally clean just using this. But, I already always double cleanse anyways, and I like how gentle this is so I’m not overly stripping my face.<br /><br />This is such a nice, gentle cleanser. After using it, my face doesn’t feel stripped or dry. Usually, after I wash my face it feels tight and dry and I need to put on moisturizer. After using this, my face doesn’t feel that way. I don’t feel like I HAVE to apply moisturizer.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great choice for a gentle cleanser!

Such A Great Set!,"[[VIDEOID:a7c1d14af37e75840e647b8774b319cb]] I have been wanting to get a variety of different liquid glitter eyeshadows, but I kept only finding them where you have to buy them individually. I was happy to see this set of 4!<br /><br />These liquid glitter eyeshadows are GORGEOUS!<br /><br />They come in a product box. The tubes of product have gold caps and clear tubes, so you can see the shade. The brand name and logo is on the front of the tubes in gold. The applicator is a nice sized doe foot - not too big for my small eyes, but big enough. These are short tubes, so the applicator is short. But, it’s still easy to hold and maneuver. The shade number and name are on a sticker on the bottom of the tube.<br /><br />You get 4<br />- 001 Mauve Plum - Mauve liquid shadow with silver glitter.<br />- 002 Rosy Gold  - Rose gold liquid shadow with silver glitter.<br />- 003 Silver Flash - White liquid shadow with silver glitter<br />- 004 Sparkle Midnight - Black liquid shadow with silver glitter.<br /><br />They all look so beautiful. The shimmer with them looks even with application. You can layer them well. They don’t take too long to dry. They lasted well on my hooded eyes without creasing (that is, no more than what I normally get with any eyeshadow). When the light hits these they look so beautiful.<br /><br />I show photos of swatches - I did 1 swipe for each color. Then I did little areas where I layered the colors to show how they built up. I also did a video showing them.<br /><br />I think this is such a great set! To get 4 liquid glitter shadows for $13.99 (at the time of writing this review), I think that’s a great deal! All other liquid glitter shadows I’ve found were sold individually and buying 4 would have been way more than this set costs! I’m definitely going to be using these up and hoping they’ll come out with additional colors soon!!",B08DK5D9J5,1606080727104,5.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Provides Great Coverage. Feels Nice On Skin & Looks Smooth!,"This comes with an outer product box. It has the same appearance as the tube of foundation - black with white wording. There’s also a little rectangle in the shade, with the shade number and name. The product packaging looks nice. It comes with a product card saying they love to hear from you and 2 samples for hair products (which I thought was odd for hair products with foundation, but whatever 😂) - 1 for “RG II Hair Loss Clinic Premium Shampoo” and 1 for “Sohair Morocco Argan Oil Hair Essence.” I didn’t try either of the samples so can’t say anything for how those work.<br /><br />The foundation comes in a squeeze tube. When you twist off the main top, there’s a protective seal. I usually like pumps with my foundations. But, I don’t mind this being a squeeze tube. It isn’t messy at all. I just squirt some out onto my brush or sponge, dab it in areas on my face, then blend it out.<br /><br />They don’t have a large range of shade options - there’s only 2. With BB & CC creams, they’re usually so thin that a shade that’s a little off from you is usually still okay. I got the shade “#1 Light Beige.” I’m pretty pale. I can make the shade work for me, but I do wish it was a tad lighter. See my photos. I did a photo showing a drop of this Bb Cream, then a swatch doing 1 swipe with a small amount on my finger, then took what was left on my finger from the swatch and dabbed it and blended it out. I also show a photo of a swatch of this BB Blemish Cream, where I also show some blended out. Then I compared it to a swatch of L’Oréal Infallible Pro Glow in 201 Classic Ivory and Maybelline 24 Hr Foundation in 102 Fair Porcelain (I tried to use foundations most people might have tried). As you can see, both are lighter than this BB Blemish Cream. The Maybelline is MUCH lighter. I’m pretty pale, but even that one is a tad too pale for me, so I always have to warm it up with bronzer. But, this BB Blemish Cream is definitely on the darker side for me, but I’m able to make it work.<br /><br />The formula feels nice. It isn’t too thin or runny. It feels nice and creamy. On the product info page it said, “BB Cream Tinted Moisturizer Blemish Balm lets you perfectly blend & build tones from sheer to medium coverage.” Most BB creams I’ve tried are usually sheer to light, not able to go up to medium coverage. But, this actually provides a lot more coverage than I expected with a BB cream! I usually don’t go for BB/CC creams that often because they’re such light coverage. But, there’s times when I want lighter coverage and was looking for a new BB/CC cream and figured I’d give this a try. I’m really glad I did! It evens out my skin tone like I’d expect with a BB cream, but also provides decent coverage too. It doesn’t feel dry on my skin. You can also build it up too if you want, and it doesn’t look dry or cakey. I’d say you can get anywhere from really light coverage (like just evening out your skin tone and maybe covering small, light spots with a thin layer) to good medium coverage (if you build it up some). It builds up nicely enough where it might even be considered full coverage to some, but for me I consider it medium coverage 😂 I can’t build it up too much on myself because the color isn’t a good enough match for me. The more I build it up, the more it doesn’t match my skin. So, when I use this since it’s not really light enough for me, I can only use a thin layer of it. But, I did build it up just to test it out for this review and it looks nice and smooth on the skin whether you’re doing a light layer or building it up.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a really great BB cream! It gives you more coverage than other BB creams I’ve tried. I like the squeeze tube. The product feels and looks nice on the skin. I definitely recommend giving this a try if you’re looking for something that will give you light to medium coverage while looking nice, smooth, and not dry or cakey.",B08DXCVRNY,1605801795952,5.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"Bad Smell, Don’t Wipe Off Makeup Easily","They come in a nice little disposable pack. Theres a plastic area where the top opens and closes. The opening for the wipes wasn’t big enough. It had the little plastic opening with the split in the middle, and it was just TINY! I ended up cutting the plastic part off, and then the opening was big enough.<br /><br />The wipes are a good size. They are nice and soft. However, they have a weird smell - like cardboard? I don’t know. I can’t really place it, but I don’t like it.<br /><br />The wipes aren’t too wet. I do a lot of makeup swatches of eyeshadow palettes and things like that. So, I constantly am using makeup wipes to wipe the swatches off of my arms. These work good for that. I wouldn’t use them on my face because, while they’re wet enough to wipe the swatches off my arms, I need to rub more than I do with my usual wipes. Given that, I wouldn’t want to use them on my face where I’d need to rub hard, pulling my skin. It’s not good to use makeup wipes to remove your makeup anyways, since it can tug at your skin and because they usually don’t remove all of your makeup. I still sometimes like to use makeup wipes to wipe the majority of my makeup off, then go in and cleanse my face. But, again, I just wouldn’t use these for that. With the odd smell and needing to rub more to get the makeup off, I wouldn’t want to use these on my face. But, for getting the swatches off my arms they work good.<br /><br />So, for purposes of wiping swatches off my arm, they work good enough. As I said earlier, with the weird smell and them being not that wet, causing me to need to rub harder, I just wouldn’t use them on my face.",B0851T7HDS,1603564306149,3.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,"STRONG Smell, Couldn’t Get Past The Smell to Really Use It Other Than a Drop on My Hand","When this first arrived, I was going to open the amazon packaging and I could smell a strong, medicine like scent. So, I immediately thought that it must have broken in transit. Once I opened the amazon shipping package, there was a box inside. There wasn’t anything all over the box, so I opened it, and inside was a glass bottle completely intact. I couldn’t understand why the scent was so strong if the bottle was intact. Then, I thought if I can smell it that strong now, I wonder how it’ll be using it. The scent of the packaging had such a strong medicine kind of pepper smell, it was really overpowering.<br /><br />Inside the box, there’s a product info card. It has the product on one side with what benefits it’s supposed to have. The other side has specific instructions on how and when to use, and a full list of ingredients. I really liked that!<br /><br />The product comes in a glass bottle with a dropper. The bottle seems nice and durable. The product itself is a orange-yellowish color. I applied a little to the top of my hand and it felt oily. Someone in another review said it felt oily but they expected that since it was an oil. I’m not sure if they were talking about this product or another one. This is called a serum, so I don’t really expect it to be oily. I’m not sure if it’s some kind of serum, oil combo? I have dry skin so the oiliness wasn’t too bad for me. But, I could still feel it, so if I had oily skin I probably wouldn’t even want to use it.<br /><br />Anyways, the most use I could get out of it was the little I put on the top of my hand. The scent was so strong, it made me a little sick to my stomach. I’m not usually sensitive to smells, so it must have just been this specific scent - it had a medicinal, pepper type smell. I don’t really know how to describe it, but it wasn’t for me. So, unfortunately I can’t really say whether or not this is a good product. All I can say is that it comes in a nice glass bottle with a dropper, has a really strong scent, and it feels oily. If you’re sensitive to smells, I would say this isn’t for you.",B08BZ1RHPS,1602993546225,2.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Great Clips!,"These are great! You get 20 for $7.99 (at the time of writing this review) which I think is a great deal! They are easy to open and close but clamp tightly onto the finger. They are so helpful when doing poly gel nails! They keep the mold in place, keeping it flat against the nail bed without any bubbling, giving me a smooth poly gel nail! I’m so glad I got these! They’re definitely one of those things you don’t really think you needed until you get them, then you’re wondering how you ever did it without them! If you like doing poly gel nails, these are a great help!",B088LPYXNQ,1601256127782,5.0

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,My First Nail Drill and I Love It!,"This was my first nail drill and I love it!<br /><br />It comes well packaged. It’s in a box, and everything is in it nicely.<br /><br />I’ve been doing my own nails, and wanted a drill to make it easier. I was a little scared since I’d never used one on myself before. This one was so easy! It comes with instructions. It’s so easy to work! It is easy to hold and maneuver, it isn’t too big or heavy. It doesn’t get too hot. I love that all the controls for the drill are on the power cord, so I don’t accidentally hit anything and end up hurting myself while I’m using the drill! I love how it comes with so many attachments! It even comes with a little brush so you can dust off any dust. The one thing I wish is that it had a standard plug, rather than a USB. It seems so many things are USB plugs now though, so it is what it is. But, if it had the standard plug, it would have been perfect! Other than that, I have no complaints!<br /><br />The ease of use and compact size make this perfect for a beginner like me!<br /><br />EDIT: There’s no switch or anything to remove the different heads. You just need to pull it out. They push in easy enough, but my goodness are they hard to pull out! It makes sense since you’d been using it and it was rotating. So I wish there was some kind of switch to make it easier to take out the heads. So I’m taking off 1 star because of that.",B0888CX245,1599799047458,4.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Okay...,"I wanted these because they looked short. I love fake nails, but hate really long ones. And most are so long. So, I liked that these were on the shorter side.<br /><br />I like the French manicure look. They look beautiful. However, I do not like the rhinestones. I thought that they’d be smaller. But they are so big. If they fall off, it’s pretty noticeable....and they do fall off.<br /><br />They come with an alcohol wipe, nail file, and stick to clean under your nails and push your cuticles back. If you use the alcohol pad, file your nails, and push your cuticles back, these last a decent amount of time. However, a lot of them didn’t fit the curve of my nails so the sides kept lifting up on some. That was pretty annoying and those areas just wouldn’t stick down. Also, not many of the nails fit well. So, in the product photo, the nails with rhinestones are on the thumb, pointing finger, and middle finger. I usually prefer my nails with accents (like rhinestones to either be on the thumb and ring finger or pointer and ring finger, not the first 3). I couldn’t find a nail to fit my middle finger, except for one with rhinestones so I ended up with rhinestones I’m the first 4 fingers, and I just didn’t like the look of that. It seems like you don’t have many options for fit with these nails. And I didn’t like how big the rhinestones were. So these just aren’t for me.",B088M5P8FN,1599757016448,2.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Pretty!,"This is a really pretty wig! Looks natural. Not too much shine. It’s long. Thick enough, but not where it’s heavy. Covers the wig cap well. The color is pretty too.<br /><br />It’s long so it can get tangled up easily. But if you brush it out well, it isn’t too bad, and you can run your fingers through it to easily get the tangled out too. It doesn’t shed much. It shed a few hairs when I first took it out and brushed it, but that was it. The picture is of me wearing it right after taking it out and brushing it.<br /><br />I think this is a great wig if you want something that’s affordable but good quality.",B085MCMZLX,1599754607547,4.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,A Great Mascara AND A Great Lash Curler!,"I have pretty small, hooded eyes, so it’s hard to find a lash curler that works for my eyes. The biggest issue I have is them pinching my eye when I’m clamping down to curl them. I always have to lightly clamp down to see if I’ll pinch myself and, if I will, then adjust. Then, I end up having some parts not curled. I’d been looking for a new curler for a while, when I saw this I figured it was worth a try since I also got mascara.<br /><br />Someone in the reviews had said the package came damaged. Mine also did. It wasn’t too bad, just seemed a little beat up. But, the products inside were completely fine and didn’t seem damaged at all, so I was okay with that.<br /><br />I am very picky about my mascara. Well, not so much the mascara as I am the mascara wand. With my small, hooded eyes, it makes it so I end up with a lot of mistakes of the wand hitting below my lower lash line or onto my hood. So, I prefer thinner wands. I wasn’t sure what to expect with this mascara, but I was also getting a lash curler so I figured I’d hopefully like at least 1 of them. I’m happy to say that the mascara wand isn’t too thick. It’s not extremely thin, but still thin enough so it works for me. It also has a little bend to it, which helps with application. The mascara goes on very easily and doesn’t clump up after a few coats, which is great! It stays on all day without smearing. But, it also washes off easily at the end of the day, which I always love. It’s hard to find a mascara that stays all day without smearing or smudging, but is easy to wash off. So, it’s nice this does both!<br /><br />The lash curler is amazing! It’s lightweight. It feels so nice. I love the red, black, and gold. It looks so fancy! It fits my eyes really well and curls my lashes AMAZINGLY without pinching my eyes at all! I’m really happy with it! It also comes with replacements for the rubber part on the curler, so that was great!<br /><br />For $11.99 (at the time of writing this), it’s an amazing deal! You’re getting an amazing lash curler and an amazing mascara. You can’t beat that! If you’re looking for a great mascara, a great lash curler, or both, you should definitely give this a try!",B08C24Q6LB,1598282178719,5.0
AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,Pretty Decent Set! Avoid If Sensitive to Smells!,"This is a pretty decent set! For $25.99 (at the time of writing this review), you get a lot of items!!<br /><br />I love that it comes in a cute little caboodle box! Everything fits in it great! So all of the stuff is together in one place and it’s small enough that it’s easy to store!<br /><br />The little pots of glitter cake together in a little zip lock bag, which I appreciated because some of the glitter had spilled out, so that kept it contained. It was only a few glitter particles, but I was still glad it was contained to the little bag! The poly gel tubes each come in their own little bags too, which I thought was nice. None of them leaked, but if they had it would have been very messy had they not been in a bag and still messy if they weren’t in separate bags. So, even though mine didn’t leak, I’m glad the company thought of the possibility and planned ahead just in case!<br /><br />The polishes all come in their own box. I wish they would have labeled the OUTSIDE of the boxes. The only thing on the boxes were “Nail Polish” on 2 of them and “Gel Nail Polish” on the rest. Since 2 were supposed to be the top and base coat and only 2 said “Nail Polish,” I figured those were the top and base coats. I was wrong. I’m not sure why 2 said “Nail Polish” and the others said “Gel Nail Polish,” especially since they’re all supposed to be Gel polishes 🤷‍♀️ So, I had to open each box and look at each nail polish bottle to see which ones were which. The base and top coats were labeled on the outside of the bottles. BUT, the colored polishes weren’t labeled in any way. So the only way to figure out which color was which was to open each one. A minor inconvenience, but annoying when they could have just labeled them with the colors! So, I ended up putting a dot of the polish on the top of each box so I’d know in the future. It would just be nice if in the future the company labels them better!<br /><br />The polish STINKS! It smells like burnt plastic 🤢 All Nail Polish stinks, but I’ve gotten used to the “regular” stink of nail polish. Smelling burned plastic while painting my nails is not something I’ve gotten used to! But, for the price of everything I got, it’s something I can deal with. But if smells bother you, this is not the kit for you!!!<br /><br />The UV lamp works okay. I took a few times of turning it on to get the nails to dry, but it’s small so I wasn’t expecting too much and they did and it was still faster than if I painted my nails with regular polish and waited for them to dry. So I’m happy!<br /><br />Overall, it’s a good little kit! I love that it comes all together in the cute little caboodle box. I love that you got an assortment of polish colors and an assortment of poly gel colors. I love that it came with the base and top coats. I love that it came with a UV lamp. I love it came with the tool needed for the poly gel nails. I love it came with glitter, foils, and strip tape to decorate the nails. I didn’t like that the polishes weren’t labeled better and I didn’t like the burnt plastic smell of the polish. But for everything I love and the affordable price for everything you get, I can get past those 2 things I didn’t like!!<br /><br />I’d say the only thing that would make me tell you to avoid getting this kit would be if you’re sensitive to strong smells because of the burnt plastic smell from the polish. Other than that, I’d recommend this kit!!",B087G54FLM,1597577229511,3.0
AHBFC446AIQBMLC3U4SV6YJJERPQ,"Smells Wonderful, Good Lotion For Dry Skin","It's nearly summer here in New England, which means lots of time swimming and sunning. As a result, quality lotions are needed. That is why I requested this one. This review is of: Spanature Aloe Vera Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection Made In Korea 75 ml/2.53oz (4pcs)…<br /><br />As the product information states, this comes as four cute boxes of lotion, great for gift giving. Inside the boxes, all four tubes of lotion do have foil caps, so your safety was considered.<br /><br />The lotion itself smells light and airy to me, not heavy. It's also not very thick, and for that reason I do not like it as a hand lotion. I'm washing my hands all the time and I really need something thick to really moisturize and coat my hands. However, for a body that's been in the sun and/or water, this lotion is absolutely perfect and quite effective. It's a bit thin as I said, but it absorbs quickly and seems to last for at least 3-4 hours. (I am talking really dry skin here, so for you, it would probably last longer.)<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this Spanature Lotion. I think these would make for a nice small gift or stocking stuffer, or of course, a gift to yourself.",B08LPGZMQK,1623945385178,4.0

This review is of: Got2B Glued 2in1 Spray Wax, translucent, 8 Ounce.<br /><br />Being that this is an entirely new product for me, it took me a few tries to get just the right amount to hold my hair back from frizzing and flying away, but I did find it. I like this better than hair spray because it doesn't make my hair crunchy while still keeping my style. I do sometimes have some flyaways near the end of the day, so I don't know if the hold fades or what exactly is happening, but 9 hours of hold is pretty good.

AHBFC446AIQBMLC3U4SV6YJJERPQ,"Good Kit, But No Bottle and You Will Need Acetone","Since I recently requested and started using a Gel Polish kit, I found myself in need of some gel polish remover tools, so I requested this product from Vine. This review is for: Nail Polish Gel Remover Tools Kit for Women with Nail Clip Caps, Nail File, Nail Remover Cotton Pads,Brush, 2-in-one Cuticle Scraper/Pusher.<br /><br />First things first, I was surprised to come here to write this review and discover that I received no dispenser bottle as listed and pictured in the product description. Since this kit does NOT come with the remover liquid,  you are going to have to buy some acetone. (In my state, you must be 21 to buy it.) Since this came with no bottle, I followed the directions on the acetone itself, and used a glass measuring cup in which to pour it. (This way if I didn't use it all, I could easily pour it back into the bottle. Note to self, buy another measuring cup!)<br /><br />With that out of the way, this kit worked as described. I used tweezers and soaked the little pads in acetone and then wrapped it around my nail and applied the clamp. I did this to all of my nails at once, because my husband was here to help me with the second hand. If you have no one to help you, then you're going to need to do each hand separately. It is impossible to do much with these clamps on your fingernails. Once the clamps are on, you need to wait at least 20 minutes before removing them, to soften up the polish.<br /><br />Once I removed the clamps I set to work scraping off the polish. It does NOT come right up like regular polish does, but if you've soaked them for 20 minutes, and you applied it in thin layers when you originally polished them, it's easy to scrape the rest of it off. Once you're done, your nails look pretty bad. It will be necessary to buff them out and then wash them and apply some moisturizing lotion because your nails and the tips of your fingers will be very, very dry.<br /><br />I have heard some real horror stories of people trying to get gel nails and gel nail polish off, but this kit made it much easier and alleviated my fears. Other than the missing dispenser bottle, I'm rather happy with this kit.",B08CZ5JZMZ,1618235195055,4.0

AHBFC446AIQBMLC3U4SV6YJJERPQ,Just Okay,"Since I've started wearing makeup again, I wanted to get some makeup remover wipes, most especially for removing waterproof mascara. When I saw these up for request, I clicked right away.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm not that happy with these. I do like the design of the package-the plastic cover that clicks closed. (Resealable ones I've used in the past don't stay resealed because the adhesive wears off over time.) Trying to get one of the wipes out was difficult, because it doesn't seem like the slit is begin enough to pull them out. Once I got the first one out, though, it did become easier.<br /><br />Most days, I'm only wearing eye makeup lately, because I'm always wearing a face mask at work and a lot of foundation rubs off on those. For waterproof mascara, these wipes do NOT remove it all, AND you have to wipe pretty darn hard to get anything off at all.<br /><br />Look, I'm a maturing woman, I don't need to be rubbing and rubbing and rubbing around the area of my eyes. No, these don't contain anything that irritated by eyes, but I feel like I'm rubbing my skin OFF-that's how much pressure I had to apply.<br /><br />These might work better at removing foundation, but since I'm not bothering with that right now, (because..face masks), I'm only reviewing these for how they remove waterproof mascara and that answer is just barely....okay.",B0851T7HDS,1605111494917,3.0

After a while, it does not reseal and the wipes dry up. That is the reason I was interested in these.<br /><br />They work great! They come in a box, and each towelette is individually wrapped. If you travel a lot, or just want to keep one or two with you in your purse, you can do that and not have to worry about them drying up.<br /><br />All you do is remove it from the wrapper, dunk it quickly under running water and then squeeze.

AHBFC446AIQBMLC3U4SV6YJJERPQ,Great!,"It seems like I've had an itch in the upper and middle part of my back for months now. It's just so irritating!<br /><br />I requested this product in the hopes it would help me out and it has. I basically use my loofah to apply suds to the scrubby side, then it's just a matter of figuring out where to place your hands so that you reach your trouble areas. I like screaming hot showers, but I know they help to dry out my skin. I can combat that with lotion and loofahs, but it's hard to loofah the center part of your back, you know?<br /><br />The other side of this scrubber is for a massage type feel, but I wasn't digging that as much as the other side. I did wish that there was some way to make more suds on both sides, like a loofah does, but it works. It came with little hooks that you can stick on to your shower walls/tiles, from which you can hang your loofah, your scrubber and whatever else.

AFBUKVT3KQFLL4X536HS4KKBBJ7Q,Helps your skin absorb moisturizer.,"I love the combination of these two rollers.  The microneedle roller is great for rolling your face before applying moisturizer.  It helps your skin absorb it better.  I also use it on my eyebrows.  I have very sparse eyebrows.  I am applying hair growth serum on them.  I roll my eyebrows, apply the serum and then roll it again to help it get better absorbed.  It really seems to be helping!  I have fine hairs growing back in.  I also like the derma roller.  I put it in the refrigerator.  It feels so good to roll over your forehead and across your eyes.  Helps to relieve headaches too.  This is a nice duo to add to your daily facial routine.",B07HVRP37G,1613858493631,5.0

The daylight one can be a little too much.  You can definitely see every flaw in your face!  I like that you can use this with batteries or USB charged.  I have so many other things plugged into my outlets.  This is just one less.  There are two fold out mirrors - one on top on the left side and one on the bottom on the right side.  They have different levels of magnification.  Those would be a little better if they were a little larger.  The middle mirror is the perfect size though.  This stands up on a base.  I just wish the mirror tilted back a bit farther.  It's kind of difficult to do my eyebrows without lowering my head down.  I may make a stand for it to lift it up about 2 -3"".

Fun and pretty and can go casual, party, club, bedroom, cosplay etc. the hair itself is very soft and silky with beautiful waves. The lace part is deep and looks so natural. There’s a comb at the nape. Even though there is no lace front they do a great job at the part. My only issue is that it doesn’t fit my more oblong, 22 inch head. The nape comb ends up about halfway down the back of my head, the cap is too small. SUCH A BUMMER. I’d be slaying in this beauty. I wish it fit but I could feel it slipping when I tried it on. If noble could just make their caps a little bigger I’d be so happy because they have some of the best quality wigs. My head is normal size so it’s not asking much!

A little amount smooths on nicely, making my face feel instantly moisturized without feeling greasy or heavy. It definitely feels like it has more youthful plumpness to it (I’m 37). It absorbs pretty fast, within about 10 min I can no longer feel it on my face. Since using it I haven’t felt any tightness in my skin. It has a nice clean soap like fresh scent to it.

AFDYIK3FNPY2JFBQYUWC6GSBMIRQ_2,Bad quality- short hair except for the back,"So disappointed in this unit and I feel like it’s a waste of real human hair. I had to put a lot of work into it to make it look halfway decent. As it came the curls are super tight and when worn looks like some 80s Gerry curl type thing. Not a good look. Even with the tight curls you could tell how short it was on the sides compared to the back. So I took my flat iron out and straightened it out at 350 degrees. As you can see it wouldn’t go completely straight, but I didn’t want to use a higher heat and damage the hair. I’m ok with it being wavy, but as I straightened it all the tiny broken  filler hairs on top of the unit became extremely obvious. Not sure what they were thinking when they made this. It’s clear to achieve the “16 inch” length they only added long hair at the back bottom of the unit, leaving the sides short. Now the whole reason I wear wigs is because I chemically damaged my hair, and the sides are shorter than my back, JUST LIKE THIS WIG! Ugh. While it looked better wavy, it’s still a hot mess. The hairline part and cap fit funny. Like the hairline goes past the ears. The side combs are near the nape comb. The top part of the lace doesn’t lay flat to the head, I’d have to glue it down. The only way I can make this hair look decent is if I wear a head scarf with it, to pull back and hide the short sides. The hair itself isn’t even all that great. It’s a mess on top and feels dry. The only reason why I’m giving it two stars is because I can make it look cute with the scarf. If I would have paid money for this I would have returned it immediately.",B08LG68MGH,1611541981805,2.0

Many shower caps can't handle the volume of hair and the big clip but this cap is a great size and covers all of my head/hair without a problem. I also love the extra detail of the lining on the front edge of the cap, maybe silicone(ish).

I rinsed it off just before it was completely dry and it rinsed off easily and thoroughly. After rinsing it off my skin is left so soft, smooth and clean feeling! It also doesn't dry out my skin at all which for me is great since my skin can dry out pretty easily especially with clay masks.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this clay mask!",B08L4HTQ3R,1613625990398,5.0

There was also a lot of extra serum in the packet so I'm able to use the extra serum 3 to 4 times in the morning and at night which is a nice perk.

AHF2R43HMV6S2J42LN6NLQTRBLJA,Great for pampering yourself and making you feel good,I got these most recently from this brand as I have had a great experiance with others from this brand my favorite being there bubble sheet mask I love seeing the effects of the mask in action and it always leaves my face with a fresh and pampered sensation. They are fairly easy to get out of the packaging the mask does take some manuvering when it comes to opening it up. The eye holes could be just a little larger as I have big eyes. Other than that the mask sits nicely on the face it doesn't move around and it has a cooling sensation to it when applied.

AHF2R43HMV6S2J42LN6NLQTRBLJA,"Cute kit,love the variety but fell in love with the one in the tube","First impressions I have to start with the packaging which I think was cute in a way. I have not ever heard of this brand or used it before now and since getting it have heard great things about certain products from this little kit. I will say from this kit my favorite is the primer in the squeeze tube that I add in with a matte primer and it does a great job at minimizing pores which is something I have a problem with on my nose,cheeks and chin and this does a great job at covering up those problem areas and looks great under makeup. I wasnt the biggest fan of the 2 other primers and havent really played with them a whole lot not in comparison to the one in the squeeze tube. Overall this would be the one I would repurchase and reuse time and time again.",B08F4ZDVZQ,1614409333963,4.0
AHF2R43HMV6S2J42LN6NLQTRBLJA,Does work but you have to be a patient person as this could take weeks to fully happen,Alright so I got this for me and my husband to try on his vacation which we did this on 9/10/21 it is now 1/29/21. I will start from the beginning. This was the first time ever doing anything like this for me and my husband so we werent sure what to expect with the process. When you take these out I will caution you to watch how much you cute the parts that go on your feet as I cut my husband's too wide and some of the liquid that is inside did come out. So you know there is liquid inside each of the bags that go on your feet that feels weird on your feet and cold. We left on for the recommended time of an hour the process is explained in detail which I will give them kuddos for. Now after we let them stay on for an hour we then showered them off I placed lotion on my feet the first night again not sure what to expect and I didnt want this to dry my feet out too much as to where my husband didnt have a preference so he did not lotion his feet. He started seeing the peeling first. Now keep in mind I do get pedis and my last one was probably in March of 2020 and since then I have used a foot file and soak during that time. My peeling did not start until halfway thru the week so I thought that was important to mention. He does not get his feet done and never has. His peeling lasted about a week. We are about what a week and half in of peeling 2 weeks in since I did the foot mask my feet still look aweful and they are still peeling. I have started to apply lotion to the feet to see if this will help the process and only have seen minimal improvement. Now keep in mind I am an impatient person. Also to mention a burning and tingling sensation is expected its what we felt during the process once we were done. Overall I think I will stick to my parifan drips and doing my feet the way I have been doing I will say that it did wear down a few calluses I had on my feet its just the process I am not patient enough for I dont mind wearing socks too much but this is more of being forced to wear socks so I dont shed everywhere and even then I still find dead skin somewhere. This process was horrible to me and I think there are better ways to get these results. My husband didnt too much mind the process and his feet were in worse conditon than mind and his process didnt take as long and for me that was even more frustrating. This would not be something I would recommend unless you are a patient person and dont mind waiting like this for results I just want to let my feet breath again.<br /><br />Update: 2/2 My foot is still peeling this is def something I will not be doing again for me its about the fact that this is suppose to be something that takes time but really this amount of time for me is ridiculous and I can get the results its providing by using a foot file after soaking is that process more difficult yes but I get results within an hour not almost a month. My feet look nasty and dry even lotion isn't helping.,B07SY7WPS4,1611904481440,2.0
AHF2R43HMV6S2J42LN6NLQTRBLJA,"Easy to use,works great and has a sensor inside so you dont have to push buttons","I am totally new to the idea and concept when it comes to doing gel nails at home myself. This was the first time I have owed and used a UV lamp by myself to cure my nails. I def like the initial unpackaging the machine itself looks professional and well made. It plugs into the wall the cord could be a tad longer but it was workable. I didnt read over the instructions since I have seen this machine be used both in the nail salon on a number of ocassions not regularly but I am a quick study. I have also seen ppl I watch on youtube use machines like this as well so I was familar with the concept of what your suppose to do. Now I did pair this with gel polish that I had never used before so my review may not be the best since I am unfamilar with both the product and the products used but it is coming from a first time user as I am sure there are others out there like myself. So in use I will say the machine does get warm not hot but warm depending on how long your using it. The light is very bright and def caught me off guard. The buttons are extremely easy to use but I love that the machine also has a sensor so you dont have to push the button if you dont need to which I thought was a nice touch. The only downside of that is if you lift your palm up then it goes off so its extremely important to pay attention to the numbers you were on for curing sake. I will say thou using this machine at first with the base coat that I was using it came out tacky so my first thought is great I was excited about using this and it doesnt all the way work but once I thought to just go ahead and apply the first layer of polish, cure, and then do the top coat everything was fine. So overall this works great and I look forward to using again in the future as I begin experimenting with both gel polish and poly gel (I think its called). As stated I am a quick study and I dont think I did too bad of a job my first time around.",B08L6GXY2S,1606544347572,4.0

He has told me that he really likes the way this shampoo cleans his beard and the fact that it lathers well without having to apply much product which for me is a win cuz that means less money spent in the long run.

AHF2R43HMV6S2J42LN6NLQTRBLJA,Takes time and patience,"I choose these because I've seen these before product curls without the heat and it was as simple as applying them and letting your hair air dry. Well let me tell you it takes alot of practice and patience and knowing what your doing. Is it simple enough to understand, yes. However the sectioning hair, getting tangled, knotted or stuck was alot of the problems I ran into. If my husband had not been home I think I might have been in some real trouble. I'm not mild tempered and almost was pulling my hair out trying to get it unstuck at some points. I will say there were times when I got a rhythm going and I was getting my hair to go thru effortlessly but in the end once I was done I found pieces that weren't even in there and it was uncomfortable to wear unless maybe I was up doing stuff around the house. In the end I took it down and I'd had enough of the torture these provided. Overall would I suggest these yes to someone a little more familiar with there head and maybe to do in my daughter's hair but personally unless it's a day I'm bored and nothing else to do I may give it a go again. I will say my husband did see some curls in my hair when I ended up taking them out they didn't stay that way but he said he could see results and that was just in a matter of getting them all in. There may be potential there just not patience in my book.",B087FTZSZH,1597716806079,3.0

It is very pigmented, I only swatched it once and it was full coverage. Some of the polishes in this set are very unique like the ones with fur or hair on them, I’ve never seen polishes like that before. They apply smoothly and are a nice good thick consistency. Do not let the size of the bottle fool you, these gel polishes may be packaged small but they pack a good punch.

I like this set because you get almost all the colors in a rainbow without breaking the bank and an added bonus, depending on how you look at it, is that they are small so you’re more likely to use it all instead of the polish just sitting there. The one thing for me was that the blue glitter polish was very sheer and I needed like 4 coats to build it up but the other colors worked great. I definitely like this little set.",B08K8P7LN6,1611729093231,5.0

It is very sheer despite the colors in the bottles looking very pigmented. It also peels extremely easy so acetone is not needed to remove the polish which is great for little kids. Overall, quality wise it isn't the best, for an adult, for a child this is perfect. I recommend this kit for your kids, it's very cute and fun!",B08CVTNQP1,1610818416419,5.0
AH4TB6XJJKH3WLSX2D56JYJ4Z4ZA,Pretty metallic shimmery shadows,These eyeshadow sticks are very smooth and creamy. You have to slide it on a couple of times to get good pigmentation payoff however once you use the brush to blend it out the color slowly fades and leaves you with a sheer looking shadow. You will need to reapply a couple of times to have good coverage. Overall the colors and finish are cute however the execution could use some work. I recommend this if you want eyeshadow that is not too in your face or for tweens.,B08MPK4JRB,1610432920130,4.0

AH4TB6XJJKH3WLSX2D56JYJ4Z4ZA,All you need,This make up organizer is perfect for traveling or if you do not have much space for a bigger mirror. It is small enough to carry around and makes applying makeup very easy. I love how it has silicone like holders for your lipsticks or eyeliners and brushes as well as jewelry. This is definitely something worth investing in. I got this so I can take it on the go to retouch my makeup or do it if I need to have it done last min.

AG2V56KGC2Y3VNKPON3W56ZGFOFA,I cant wait for the cologne to come out!!! Trying to find the words for the scent. Amazing,"I dont quite get the concept of 'beard balm' or even beard oil.  But I have been hearing a lot about oud wood oil and its scent.  WOW I would describe it as soft and warm.  Sort of a nice leather jacket that has been around a little pipe smoke.  Its a scent that you notice only when near someone.  Its not a scent that broadcasts itself to a whole room like a teenager cologne.<br /><br />Looks like they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.<br />So trust me, buy one of the oud products they have available, maybe just the $15 bottle.  If you arent keen on it then you just contact the seller.<br />I doubt that will happen though.  As soon as you smell it you will probably go ahead and buy the larger bottle, or maybe by then the cologne will be out.<br />Thats what happened to me.  As soon as I bought the beard balm I quickly grabbed the beard oils.  I wont be putting it in my beard but I have been mixing it into unscented hand lotion and putting it all over.<br />I wish I had adequate words to describe the scent.",B08BKWLHYP,1622093780724,5.0

AEFRTLVCVRALKXBED77KHPIXEPWQ,Great quality lashes,This was my first time ever putting on fake lashes of any kind so any issues I had may have been operator error.

AEFRTLVCVRALKXBED77KHPIXEPWQ,Very soothing,This mask looks pretty terrifying when on but it does a fantastic job of soothing the skin.

It did leave my skin a bit oily looking but I used an oil paper to pull that out and my skin looked great after that.,B08575Y9V3,1595857598728,4.0
AEFRTLVCVRALKXBED77KHPIXEPWQ,Works,It is a soft material headband and it is comfortable to wear.

AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Great formula,"I think you have to know how to use this foundation for it to work. I have a strict skin care routine and since I’ve started to really pay attention to my skin most  foundations I use look great. This is a medium coverage foundation. And you probably would need two coats to cover any dark spots and even out your skin tone. I exfoliate my face three times a week and I feel the foundation sits better on my skin when I do. The formula is light. The primer is supposed to smooth out your skin. So I mainly use it on my T zone where I have larger pores. And I apply a super glowy and dewy primer on the rest of my face. I like to apply some foundation with my finger and spread it around on my face and then I go with one of the sponges. The sponges feel a little dense. Make sure you wet them before blending the foundation. These sponges work better damp. They don’t absorb the foundation too much, which is great. The foundation blends beautifully and gives me enough coverage to cover my imperfections. I do like to set it with powder as well and it usually works great under powder. I’d like to set it because I feel like it lasts all day long then when I don’t. Make sure you hydrate your skin very well before applying this foundation. I love how it looks on my skin.",B08SBV6Z57,1630679340150,4.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Amazing for m extremely dry skin!,"I’ve been really enjoying this face oil. I have super dry skin and it moisturizer some dry patches I have. I love that it doesn’t leave a greasy or tacky feeling. The oil absorbs quickly into the skin. I like to use it after my vitamin C serum. I also like to go in with a toner. And it mixes well with the rest of my products. I don’t get any irritation when mixing it retinol either. I like to apply directly on my face. And I think my favorite method is to mix it in with my foundation. I found that my foundation looks a bit cakey and this face oil, really gives me a nice dowy finish. Sometimes I like apply it  before bedtime but I do find that it sticks a tad to my pillowcase but every product usually does. So the most important for me is that it doesn’t break out.",B08RRSPNWV,1630087557264,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Really great,"I live down South, in South Florida, and I'm no stranger to a nice coconut scent. This body wash smells so nice. The other thing about that, is that the scent actually hangs around for a while after you exit the shower. It leaves you smelling nice and tropical. From an aromatherapy perspective, it makes the shower experience really lovely. Couple of pumps on the old loofah, and it lathers up extremely well for full body coverage. I can't stand body washes that require half the bottle to maintain a good lather. This one is not one of those. It cleans very nicely, and does a bang up job of leaving me feeling nicely hydrated as well. So the natural moisture from my skin is not stripped away, and I'm left feeling clean and smelling wonderful. I actually lost it to my wife, who gave it a try and insisted that it was no longer mine, and that I was not allowed to touch it. Because I consider myself a gentleman, I gave in to her demands, and sadly gave her all of the wonderful shower experiences going forward from that point on. That being said, it speaks to how nice a shower experience you'll get from this body wash. I do recommend it.",B08SG2MBRY,1629893512854,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Great for skin and nails,"I’ve been taking collagen supplements for six months now and I do have to say that my nails, skin and hair have definitely improved tremendously. I usually take my collagen in the morning. I like powder  over pills because I like to add it to my coffee. So I decided to try this one which is supposed to be taken at night. I like to add it to a big glass of water. It does take a while to stir and dissolve completely. But it ends up dissolving. It doesn’t have a strong taste. I don’t taste anything at all. So that’s a positive thing for me. It doesn’t disrupt my stomach. I don’t get any aches from this at all. My skin is definitely looking a lot clearer and glowy. I don’t find much hair cut up in my comb like I used to. My nails are definitely stronger. Overall yes certain things have improved. But you have to be persistent to see results.",B08XQYZWCS,1629771854108,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Excellent hydrator,"I have to say, that my experience with Korean skin care products is really fantastic. I do have combination type skin with an oilier T zone, and drier areas that surround my chin. As such, I do find it difficult to find products that walk that fine line between exacerbating the oiliness and solving the dryness, or tamping down the oiliness and exacerbating the dryness. Hydrating products generally don't do too well for my T zone, but I need them for my dryer spots that surround my chin. This recovery cream works extremely well at hydrating the skin, and is a nice texture and consistency that saturates very well and doesn't leave the skin feeling greasy. That is key for me, because I was able to use it on all of my face, and not worry about exacerbating either issue that I have. I found that the finish that it left on my oilier t zone, was surprisingly matte, and not glossy at all. As for the dry areas around my chin, this cream did wonders. At first I thought to use it as a spot treatment cream for myself, using it only on my chin to hydrate the dry skin that I have there, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that I could use it on both my oily skin, and my dry skin. A little of this cream certainly goes a long way, as I only needed about a dime to a nickel sized amount, in order to cover my entire face. The flaking skin issues that I often have on my chin, were completely alleviated. In my experience, this is another hit for Korea's skin care industry. I found the packaging to be rather subdued, but certainly adequate enough considering the price point. That for me is another nice thing, as I found it to be fairly reasonably priced. All in all, my experience with it was tremendous, and so I would recommend it.",B08QVJ4NVD,1629571947128,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,It’s ok,"These were really hard to open. I just couldn’t get it right. I got the chance to try these for free thanks to the vine program. If I had paid for these I wouldn’t of been happy. I wasn’t really impressed with the product itself. I thought it wasn’t hydrating enough. And just for  seven days worth, i didn’t really see any improvements on my skin. It absorbs quickly and all but felt that my skin was really dry after half an hour. I think I was just expecting more that I ended up disappointed. I do have to say that it worked well with the rest of my products. I like to use retinol, glycolic acid and vitamin c. I didn’t get any burning sensation after applying this right after my retinol. I didn’t get any redness as well. I just would have wanted more hydration.",B08VQY1Z1S,1629331805390,3.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Great for everyday,"I live in sunny South Florida, so it's important that I do my best to try and protect my skin from the sun even with casual exposure. This is a very expensive and small quantity of sunscreen, but I think if you look at it for particular application it might be worth it. I used it entirely for a face sunscreen. It does extremely well to saturate into the skin and I didn't find it gave me a white cast at all, which is what I really appreciate about it. It can do very well as an everyday wearing type sunscreen that will give you protection from the sun, while at the same time moisturizing your skin. As a matter of fact, I found as a moisturizer it worked very well. I appreciate very much the sun protection SPF 50 that it has, because the sun where I live can certainly get very strong. I usually dislike sunscreens, because of the oily nature of them, but I found this one to be well balanced, and didn't leave me feeling greasy at all. I also found that it had a bit of a matte finish to it, so you didn't notice any sort of shining, especially for someone like me who tends to have an oilier t zone. In combination with that, I actually get dry areas on my chin, and this did very nicely to moisturize my dry areas while not causing any sort of exacerbation of oilier areas. All in all it's probably one of the best, if not the best sunscreen that I have ever used for my face. For everyday wear, and protection, I would certainly reach for this sunscreen without a doubt. I do recommend it.",B08NJ5BTWG,1629214068224,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,My skin feels so smooth,"I've been using this trio for over two weeks now. And already I see my skin even out. I have a lot of acne scars in this tree or really helped fade some of it away. My skin looks a lot clearer and healthy. I use this morning and night and I feel like my skin is hydrated for a long period of time. All the formulas blend nicely into the skin giving a nice healthy glow. I think if you wanna see improvement in your skin, you need to be consistent with your skincare routine, and adding something like this can really help restore and revive your dull skin. These are lightly scented which is something I really appreciate. It is a small travel size but a little bit of product goes a long way. My skin definitely looks plumper and tighter. I am really liking how my skin looks after starting using this kit.",B08S1LWF9V,1625767684071,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,pricey but very hydrating,"This is a nice hydrating moisturizer. I wouldn't say this is one of a kind product but it is better than your Walmart moisturizers. It blends nicely into the skin and does hydrate for a long period of time. I hate moisturizer that after half an hour of having it on your face feel like you haven't applied anything at all, it's so dry. But I do feel it's a little pricey. I mean, I won't tell my sister to go run and purchase it. It does work well with all of my skincare products but because this is a clean formula, I do find that after a while a tends to have an unpleasant scent. Overall, hydrating and non-greasy.",B08WF29DM9,1625693037559,3.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Impressive,"This was my first time trying a mask of this type. To be honest I didn't really know what to expect, but to make a Long story short I was very impressed. Applying this mask is a little different. You should leave your face nice and damp, and apply a very thin layer of this oxygen mask over the damp skin. The mask will begin to foam up, and you leave it applied for about 10 minutes or so. After which you simply rinse it off, and enjoy your nicely treated skin. I tend to have a little bit of a drier skin type on certain areas of my face, and so I would say that this mask did dry me out a little bit. Of course the mask isn't the final step, rather it's the first one so following it up with a good serum and moisturizer will alleviate any sort of dryness issues. What I did notice is that with prolonged use, I was seeing some pretty encouraging results with the diminishment of fine lines. I am in my 40s now, and the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines are beginning to become a reality. When I would use this mask, and then apply a nice retinol serum, and a good moisturizer overtop, I noticed that after several weeks I was seeing a pretty nice reversal of the aging process. I think it's a very high quality product, and isn't the first product that I've tried from this brand. In my experience Tonica makes excellent products, with simple packaging but are highly effective. All in all I was very pleased with my use of it, and would certainly recommend it to anyone willing to give it a try.",B08VKQY815,1624458284618,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Love it,"I tend to have very dry skin, especially when the weather doesn't help that situation like in the winter months. For myself personally, I have a couple of spots on my face, that tend to get drier than other areas. That results in dry patches of flaking skin. Needless to say, having those spots flaking, is not ideal. I wanted to try this particularly for its hydrating and moisturizing properties. I am pleased to report that this skin care product works extremely effectively. It has a very thick consistency to it, which to me indicates that it works well through its dense property. I use it after my shower in the evenings, and it totally alleviated the problems I had of any dry patches appearing on my face. I will say that it isn't in an inexpensive price range, but I'm happy with the results that I achieved when I used it. So if you can afford it, you might justify the expense. All in all it's an excellent cream, and I would certainly recommend it if you are like me, someone who suffers from dry skin and dry patches.",B08SQZ1B3W,1620847319031,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Decent,"I have found that my results with this cream are decent.  I wouldn't brag about or or anything like that, but at the same time it does do a nice job of hydrating the skin, and saturating well.  I did find that the cream was like whipped up, so being that it felt that it contained a bit of air, it didn't have the consistency that I like in creams, for them to be able to go a long way with only a little bit. That being said, it did saturate very nicely, and I found that it does a nice job if applied before bed, and in the morning, of keeping my skin well hydrated throughout the day.  The one thing I wasn't too crazy about was the scent.  I do not think that it is scented, but there is a natural smell that is a little weird.  I wouldn't really know how to describe it, but it's not terribly pleasant.  I wouldn't call it off putting either, but I'd rather it had a better overall smell.  That being said, it did perform well as a hydrating cream, and whether or not it prevents damage from your environment is difficult to judge really.",B07W1WJZFG,1615305261029,4.0

My skin feels so smooth. And overall healthy-looking. I finally love how my makeup looks too. My foundation doesn't look cakey at all. I really like these a lot!,B07T4LKC4D,1613768981801,4.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Unique experience,"At first the bar feels a little rough but it smooths out pretty quickly after that.  The lather that comes off of this is pretty intense, but I really like that.  If it's a bar of soap it better lather, and this one does for sure.  I like the shape of the soap, like little shields, because it makes it easy to hold and handle.  I don't know if that was intentional, or a nice unintended consequence of the design, but nonetheless it works well in that regard.  I do wish the bars were a little bigger.  They have the size of something you would get in a hotel, which means you'll go through them rather quickly.  I remained nice and moisturized after my shower, and did not suffer from dry skin from this bar. Does it improve immunity?  Honestly I do not see how, unless you claim it washes away bacteria and viruses from your skin, but any soap will do that.  So I doubt it, but even still I like it, and would use it again.",B086TS3BKQ,1608825159373,5.0

AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,I like it very much indeed,"Yes this is a very nice product.  I have used it for a little while now, and am liking the hydration, and hopefully with more time, perhaps a little regenerative effect on my skin to give me a nicer more youthful glow.  Retinol seems to be all of the rage lately, and to be honest I wasn't even really aware that this had retinol in it until I read the ingredients a little closer.  I started by simply applying it to my desired area via the dropper that it uses for applying the product, but I soon learned that my preferable method of using it is to mix a drop or two with my facial moisturizing cream, and spread it around that way.  I have used facial serums before, and they tended to be a little more oily and thicker.  It's for that reason that I think I prefer mixing it with my cream, because when I tried to simply apply it straight to my face, it kind of ran down my face and didn't really stay put to where I wanted it to.  that being said, I do like the effect it has given me.  My primary reason for use is hydration, which honestly I don't always achieve with my facial cream alone.  I still tend to have a dry spot or two to contend with with just a cream or moisturizer.  This mixed with the cream does not leave me with any dry spots, and I hope that with more use, I will perhaps turn back the clock a little on wrinkles and sun damaged areas, as I live in south Florida, and sun damage is easy to come by.  I really like it so far, and have high hope for continued use.  I do recommend it.",B07NPCT6L5,1606227763932,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Not great for heavy makeup,[[VIDEOID:7c7b96790999648fe591fddcf018381]] So...about these wipes. They are not the best at removing heaving makeup or waterproof makeup. I had to really rub my face with these wipes to remove some of my makeup off. It wasn't do much unfortunately. I wear a lot of makeup and I had to use like six wipes to get some of it off and than I just had to wash my face several times to completely take everything off. And I can't stand the scent of these wipes. I don't know what it is but I just can't stand the smell. Very disappointing.,B0851T7HDS,1603568657697,1.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,Super foamy!,"[[VIDEOID:69e74be6ba26ae9d29daee25655928f7]] It's a nice mousy body wash. The sent is great and super relaxing in the shower. It's hydrating too. It's just that it's not something that will last you months. It's better than my lever body wash but that lever one lasts me forever.  Because of the formula, it would be perfect to shave your legs.  Overall, it's ok.",B08KGVBW41,1603566434421,3.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,nice taste and hydration,"I live in south Florida, so sunscreen and sun protection is paramount.  You have no idea how many people I know personally, who have had skin cancer, and there are lots.  I, and my wife, do like to wear lip balm, and having one with SPF protection is great.  These panama jack ones do have SPF 45, and have a great flavor.  I think I have enough with this pack to last me a very long time, and that is a good thing.  My lips feel very hydrated, and the added sun protection for every bit of my skin is a huge deal.  These are great for a beach day, or even for those chapped lips that often happen on dry winters days, which are approaching for you northerners. I know because I lived in Canada for 22 years.  Overall I love these, and have one in my pocket at all times.",B08G5YVHQP,1603030319628,5.0
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,excellent hydration and not greasy,"I sometimes get a bit of dry skin on my face after a shower, if I have not used any moisturizer or facial lotion.  It gets to the point of flaking in some areas, and needless to say I would like to avoid that.  This cream is really nice.  I have used many creams for my face over the years, but I think this is my favorite so far.  It is thick and moisturizes without being greasy.  It also saturates very well, and quickly.  I hate creams that you need to work into the skin for a long time, and this one is not like that at all.  I find that a little goes a long way, and so I just dab my finger in the jar, and put a few spots of cream on my face, then spread it around, and it seems like I hardly use any at all.  Even though, the amount that I use, does the trick, and I have not had any dry skin.  It comes in some pretty nice packaging, but most importantly it works very nicely, and delivers good results for daily moisturizing to avoid dry skin.  I do recommend it!",B0851QJPZY,1603027816246,5.0

The scrub has an interesting texture...it's almost like a powder. My skin felt super smooth after exfoliating, so it does the job. It does get a little messy I have to say.  When I would grab some with my hands some of it spilled on the tub but it's easy to rinse off and didn't stain my bathtub. I love it...it's just a little messy.",B07D5FBFQ4,1601669307032,4.0

All the petal balls are in color foil.  The smell isn't the best and they aren't labeled so I was unsure what flower ball I was using.  These could really be a wow in a bathroom or add to your bath time enjoyment if they were larger, had a better smell and you could tell which petal ball you were using.",B08KT7FCYY,1609773580804,3.0

I was excited about trying this.  I’ve used it for a few days and adult didn’t notice a huge change in the tone.  It does feel somewhat softer though<br />I’m also not a fan of the packaging.

AFVOZ4UNUZKEQ7GTQ3IHQY7PZ5FA_1,Lotion after using serum is the way to go,This peptide lotion is awesome you can feel it working the second you put it on. It's a very concentrated formula of pure extract and there is no shortage of quality as you work it into the face and neck. I enjoy serums and different types of liquids but there is nothing like a good old fashioned lotion with pure ingredients to nourish especially when you live in a dry area like I do,B07RBSLNFR,1621119973981,5.0
AFVOZ4UNUZKEQ7GTQ3IHQY7PZ5FA_1,Spreads easily and softens skin,I got this for my sons face because his cheeks have been getting extra dry and the other sunscreen was not helping.  It is very moisturizing and the skin felt silky smooth after just one application.  It gives off sun protection for a while but i would definitely keep applying it throughout the day to keep it at SPF50.<br />Im glad it doesnt have the popular bad chemical sunscreen ingredients but it does list a lot of chemical ingredients ive never heard of.

AFVOZ4UNUZKEQ7GTQ3IHQY7PZ5FA_1,Not Impressed.  Too large in size to use.,I dont think the picture description is very fitting for this.  The jaw piece is a lot larger in person than how it looks in the womans mouth in the picture.  I found it to be HUGE.  I could barely fit it in my mouth.  I have to overextend my jaw just to try to slide it in there and it does not fit comfortably at all.  I wish that this product worked for me because I really want to start exercise my jaw but this one simply just is WAY too LARGE!

AGS4KJHF5LOOWT2A5TJJFMB24VOA,Firm hold is apt,Product description as firm hold is spot on. Mind you 'firm' is not a 'strong' hold but it does manage to lock in short'ish hair properly in place with all the benefits of a wax styled product (ie - does not stiffen the strands). Product is listed as a 'matte' finish and while this is mostly true - when applied to dried hair it does leave behind a slightly greased finish. That said its a decent styling product that applies efficiently to the strands and gives you just the right level of control.,B07ND4HPHT,1583724919741,4.0

AGCGQWDEGSGIIT7AZZ7RGY5ZU74Q,Clean and no odor,"This is a wonderful carrier oil set, or oil set to use on it's own. I have found the cleanest moisturizing products are single ingredient oils.

I have tried quite a few face rollers including materials like rose, and green quartz, stainless steel, regular single rollers and 2 rollers such as this one.<br />This design in particular is very easy to roll throughout the face. It is not as heavy as a similar design I have but with rose quartz spheres.<br />Feels cooler for a longer time since it is stainless steel and more importantly, it is not porous which avoids bacteria contamination on your face.<br />I use this roller almost every night while watching TV, which feels very soothing and relaxing.<br />Great gift for anyone!",B08RYN11N9,1627425119437,5.0

All 4 tubes come sealed.<br />Size is perfect to keep it in a drawer, in your purse or backpack.<br />I keep one in my night stand to use it at night since aloe is really good to moisturize and keep hands soft.

AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,Great for Korean 7-skin method!!,"This product is a great option if you want to do the Korean 7-skin method, which consists on cleansing your face and then applying 7 layers of a toner or a lightweight, watery essence to your face and after that moisturize your face. This will help your skin to keep moisturized throughout the day and be radiant and bouncy all day long.

AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,"Effective, nice scent, great touch dispenser bottle","When I think about nail polish remover, the first thing that comes to my mind is the strong not-so-pleasant acetone scent. However, this nail polish has removed that association. It has a sweet smell that is not strong and somehow pleasant.<br />I had no issues while removing purple nail polish from my toes. It did not tinted my skin like other acetone based nail polish removers. It also left my toes a little oily, which is also something totally different to what I am used to after removing nail polish because it's usually the opposite.<br />The touch dispenser bottle is awesome, just push it down and your cotton ball will get wet avoiding spills. I don't want to go back to the regular bottles after this one!!!",B08NC4378M,1616979406854,5.0
AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,"Great mascara, great price, environmental friendly company!","I absolutely love this mascara, it was easy to apply, no issues with the bristles. It does not flake or smudge. When I removed it, it was very easy, I did not even needed to use makeup remover, I just got one of my reusable pads, got it wet, rubbed my eyes a few times and done.<br /><br />In addition to the above, it is hypoallergenic and package and overall the ingredients are environmental friendly.

It cures in about 60 seconds with a good UVLED lamp (48W).<br />I did my nails at home and they did not last 2 weeks, 10 days tops, but it might be the technique I am using. Not a pro but still learning all tips and tricks. I will be adding dehydrator and primer in addition to the base coat to see if that can make them last longer.",B085QDWHQJ,1609787362531,4.0
AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,Great variety of poly gels,"9 different colors you can choose from, 3 of them are glitter/sequins. A free gift is included which is basically gold glitter.<br /><br />The dual forms are way to big for my hands, good thing I had another set of dual forms already.<br />It also comes with the ""gold stickers"" nail extensions in case you want to mold your nails from the top. But you got to have some practice to follow this approach. Otherwise, it will take you forever to distribute and mold your nails.<br /><br />All poly gels come sealed. They do match the color listed on the outside of the little bottle. Even though they are small, they can last a few rounds since you don't need a lot of product for each nail.<br /><br />Once the poly gel is cured, you will need to apply a top coat since they are sticky after cured.",B08DHZW3LK,1609283833682,4.0
AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,Perfect to reduce frizz!,"I love this set!! Microfiber is the best especially for wavy/curly hair. It helps minimize frizz and it is very absorbent.<br /><br />I found very useful the turban for whenever I am doing my makeup or I am just at home and don't want to touch my hair to avoid getting tangled or frizzy. I haven't really used it after a shower.<br /><br />The twist head towel is great for plopping your head for some time after shower. My routine using this has been: right after shower, apply leave-in, curl cream, and plop for 20 min using this twist head towel. After that, I remove the towel, apply gel and diffuse for 15-20 min. Also, I wear it ""backwards"". I know the button should be at the bottom of the head, but I found using it at the top also works for me.",B0841WQNNZ,1605905838076,5.0
AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,High quality but pricey,"Nice to have nowadays! Conveniently individually wrapped. They claimed to be unscented refresh, but they do have a slightly non-pleasant scent. Wipes are light beige with tiny brownish dots, nothing wrong with that but just different to the white plain wipes we are used to see everywhere.<br /><br />Package (both box and each wipe) is nice and high quality. Price seems to be a little high. But given the fact they are all natural (paraben-free, cruelty free, plant-based, aluminum free, etc.) and conveniently individually wrapped in case you need to get one handy in your pocket or pursue and don't have to bother with a hand sanitizer bottle (even the small ones), I think it's worth having them as an emergency. Definitely not for daily use (or several in a day).",B08DK74M1P,1604895452801,4.0
AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,Thick and good quality,"This is a good set of gel nail polish. Bottle size is average from other brands I have tried (usually between 6-8 ml), these bottles contain 7.5 ml. Gel is thicker that most brands, which is kind of good and bad at the same time. Good because you can get a great coverage with 2 thin layers. However, it is a little more difficult to apply, especially the white one that is super thick, but you will get a perfect white!<br /><br />Like any other set that does not come with base and top coat, make sure to get them before trying to use this nail polish on its own. They won't last if not using base and top coat.<br /><br />Not a fan of bottles that do not include the sticker with the color, just the number, so you either apply it to the bottle and cure them or get some nail watches, cure them and have them handy when choosing colors.<br /><br />I have not tested the durability of them (it would depend a lot of the quality of your base and top coat and how well you prep your nails). But so far, I am please with the texture and color set.",B0876VC4KM,1604694492997,4.0
AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,Excellent nail drill,"This nail drill is an excellent choice when doing your nails or re-doing them!<br />I have used it with gel nail polish and acrylic nails and works wonders.<br />USB cable only, no adapter included, but you can use any other you already have (~5V needed).<br />It is really powerful compare to other non-wired I have tried. You can regulate the speed as well. Super easy to operate, on/off switch and rotating button for adjusting the speed.<br />I like that it comes with all kind of bits, sanding bands and cuticle remover bits which are easy to swap.",B0888CX245,1602798549277,5.0
AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,Good portable set of spray and pump bottles,"This is a good set of spray and pump bottles. Full disclosure, they are small: 100ml/3.4 oz for the spray bottle (which is the approved size when using in your carry-on on a plane) and 60 ml/2 oz for the pump bottles.<br /><br />Pump bottles have a removable lock cap.<br /><br />My only complain (reason why I am rating 4 stars) is that one of the spray bottles came crushed, but I got 2 other spray bottles in perfect condition. Package was not damage at all, so I am not sure at what point of the delivery process was smashed like that.<br /><br />Any way besides that, they all work great, totally worth the money!",B08693T3XR,1602787044183,4.0
AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,"Stylish, nice colors and functional nail files!","These nail files are really nice, stylish, colors are super cute and each nail file comes with its own hard case.<br /><br />Material is soft, curve and sparkling on one side and ""rough"" on the other side. The nano glass side is gentle enough for your nails.<br /><br />You can polish, buffer or just trim your nails and will have great results. It is highly recommended to rinse your nail files after each use, warm water (a bit of soap if desire) will do the trick.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because they are too thick that it is difficult to use it when trying to file your nail from the bottom.",B088TGQFNM,1600301992450,4.0
AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,Good mascara with a tweak,"This is a good mascara. The brush is a little curve so it can help with the application.<br /><br />My first impression wasn't that good, since the mascara felt so thin that looks like I wasn't really wearing almost anything. It dried so fast that when I tried to apply the second layer, it wouldn't let me because it was already dry and the brush wouldn't run nice and soft through my lashes. However, I added 2-3 drops of castor oil (you can also use almond oil or any other natural oil that you like) and it was a game changer. I instantly felt the brush was running smoothly on my lashes, and was able to apply a second and even third layer with no problem. Lashes looked way better (not to mention they were also being lubricated with the added oil).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Does not smudge<br />- Easy to remove with makeup remover or even in the shower<br />- When removed, it comes out in small flakes which is great because it does not leave you with raccoon eyes<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Very thin mascara (although this might be a pro for some people)<br />- Felt a little dry at the beginning but manage to ""enhance"" it with castor oil (as mentioned above)",B08C24Q6LB,1598553524108,4.0
AFNCHMAKUAJOGVCKOA4XGLINHPDQ,Good quality design set!,"Let me start by saying ... I LOVE the look of these tools. The rhinestones inside a clear handle gives them such an attractive and high quality look.<br /><br />The bristles/brushes are all different sizes, same thickness. Would be nice to have a variety of thickness as well. But they are soft and work great when drawing lines or mostly any design.<br /><br />The metal part at both ends make them feel sturdy and durable.<br /><br />My only complain is that the 2nd size dotter (the pink one) is not as soft as the other. It's a bit sharp which does not work when trying to use it, but other than that all good. This is the only reason I give them 4 stars.<br /><br />I highly recommend this set!!",B08B3SJNL5,1597950313364,4.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,2-3 coats,"This is a great little set! It’s a neon set, and the colors are for sure neon. One thing to note though - the first picture in the listing made me hope that the colors would have some shimmer in them, but they definitely don’t. Looking at the other pictures, this matches up, but that shimmer was the most noticeable thing to me in the first picture so I just thought I’d mention it.<br />These polishes do cure within 60 seconds, and give decent coverage. Most of them gave full coverage in two coats, but a couple (mainly the yellow), I’d consider a third coat for. Since the polishes are quite neon, are gel (meaning fast and easy to work with), and this is standard especially for yellow neons, I’m not upset about it. Honestly, when I added a top coat over just two coats, it ended up looking pretty good, but I’d still probably add that third coat just to be sure, because… It’s neon yellow. But, overall, I’m happy with the polishes! At 8 mL, they’re also a decent sized bottle for gel polishes.",B08W8LKLHB,1625971856890,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,Comes with 8 scrunchies!,"This is definitely one of those products that I absolutely don’t need and didn’t know it existed, but now that I have one and know it exists, I love it and don’t want to let it go.<br />Honestly, this product is incredibly simple - it’s just a tube with a base, and even the base probably isn’t completely necessary.This particular holder comes with the tube and base connected and the open end of the tube facing down, so you’re unable to store anything inside of it unless you use it upside down, but then you couldn’t grab scrunchies off of it as easily. The strange thing about it is that the bottom of the base has some kind of brown paper on it - it looks like it should be removable, but it’s not. Honestly, since I’ll be keeping scrunchies on this pretty much all the time this will likely remain covered, but I still don’t like it. I would also like it better if the diameter of the tube was slightly smaller so some of my ties that are slightly smaller don’t get stretched out, but I can work with this. I’m very happy it fits perfectly on my bookcase where I wanted it to go, and I also really love that even though it’s only $10, it comes with eight scrunchies to get you started. I’ve been using one of these scrunchies all week and so far it’s holding up well - while I thought I wouldn’t like the material, it actually feels way nicer than it looks. I’m very happy with this product and am considering getting more as gifts for others later this year, if it holds up. I did get mine to use for scrunchies as the listing suggests, but you could also definitely use it for other things such as bracelets - it’s quite simple, but convenient.",B08S3B8Y5G,1620589426976,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,"Beautiful, well-behaved polishes","These polishes were exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered Krisnice creme colors! One of them is actually more of a jelly polish, but it’s a stunning color, which you can definitely build up some opacity and depth with. The others are, as I said, exactly what I was hoping for. I’ve used this brand’s magnetic polishes before, but these cremes apply just as dreamily, and have absolutely excellent coverage! A couple of them were almost one coaters, but they’re all definitely perfect within two. And, they all cure within 60 seconds, so I couldn’t be happier with them!",B0895FHBVG,1619323590972,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,Very oily,"Bottom line - this nail polish does what it’s supposed to do, I just don’t love it as much as I was hoping I would.<br />The first reason for this is that it’s oily - it leaked during shipping, so about a quarter of the shipping box was soaked in oil. Of course, since it leaked it’s all over the bottle, and since it’s oil, it’s not terribly fun to clean up. Even if it didn’t leak, I don’t love the oiliness. It definitely sticks around on your hands when you use it.<br />The second reason is the smell - as soon as I opened the shipping box, I could smell it and at first I thought it smelled wonderful, like a rainbow cherry flavored candy cane, although the smell was incredibly strong. Riding in my car with it for a few minutes, my husband and I both could smell it for the rest of the day, and leaving it in the car while we shopped for maybe an hour, the smell was overpowering when we came back out to the car. So, I let it sit in the box for a few days hoping the smell would eventually die down; it did, but when actually using the polish, it doesn’t have this same nice smell. It smells a bit like vinegar, or something similar - definitely not like acetone, and not like flowers which is like I was worried about, but still not great. Personally, I’d prefer the smell of acetone.<br />Finally, the bottle - it has a convenient flip cap and a pump you press down to dispense it which is supposed to be convenient, but in reality, it makes a mess. I think this is possibly because you have to push fairly hard on it to get any out. But, as I said, this nail polish remover does work pretty well. I used it on a polish with tiny holo glitter in it, and had no problems, and my husband had no problems getting it to remove foil or plain creme polish. Essentially, the thing both of us really don’t like about it is the oiliness. The other things we could deal with, but because of the oiliness we won’t be buying this product again after this bottle. However, if that wouldn’t bother you, we think this is a great option if you’re looking for an alternative to acetone.<br />I have provided a picture of my bottle - you can see the oiliness around the edges of the label, and you can somewhat see the oil still all over the bottle. Note that I did clean the bottle off before I used it, and have kept it upright and in a plastic bag since then - it’s just a messy product.",B08NC4378M,1616963788589,3.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,Awesome unique colors,"This is by far the most unique set of gel polishes I've ever seen... I only wish the bottles were bigger! They're only 5 mL, but you do get a lot of options so I think the price is still fair. Depending on your preference, you'll probably want 2-3 coats of each color; they're all pictured in 2, and do cure in 60 seconds. There are colored stickers already on the top of each bottle, but I don't feel they accurately show the colors inside, so I still added swatch dots.<br />The black velvet box does rub off on the white top / base coat bottles, but that's okay. One of these white bottles also had some color on it making me wonder if I possibly got a set that was returned, but I honestly like the color selection far too much to take off a star even for this.",B08GKVYS1Y,1613350340447,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,Very nice colors,"Especially for the price, these colors are very nice! They're difficult to photograph, but in the light in person, they're quite pretty. Several of the colors are jellies, but I still think you could get full coverage from them (the dark red particularly would be a beautiful, deep red). Pictured are all of the colors in two coats, but on the nails you might need three, as when holding the swatch dots up you could still see through them. They do all cure within 60 seconds. I do also like that the bottles look different than my other gel polishes do, but are still the same size / shape so they still easily fit in with the others in my storage boxes.",B08P15TB2V,1613008734480,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,$9 is a steal for these plates!,"I definitely think that Bituee is one of the better cheap stamping plate brands on Amazon... the plates don't have a plastic backing, but they're thick enough not to hurt or cut your hands (please note they are still thin enough you can bend them with your hands pretty easily if you want to). I'm not sure what the logic on putting St. Patrick's Day plates together with winter ones is, but all of the plates have really great designs and pick up well. Personally, I'm not a fan of the stamper and the scraping card this set come with, but they do definitely work. Definitely get these if you like the designs on them! They're well worth it.",B08G4Y4SFV,1609654914632,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,These colors have winter-y vibes!,"I wanted this set for the greens in it and wasn't sure how I'd like the other ones, but once I started swatching them they gave me a happy, wintery feeling so I liked them a lot better than expected! The lightest one is the only one I likely won't use often, but I love all of the others. They cover really well in 2 coats, and cure in 60 seconds. Plus, the shade names are really cute; the labels themselves are the color of the shade inside the bottle which is helpful, though it doesn't seem like the stickers are stuck on the bottle very well. And perhaps most exciting is these bottles are almost full size! They're 9 mL and full size is normally between 10 and 15 mL. Pictured are all colors in two coats, with the top coat they came with over the top - the holder in the picture is NOT the box they came in.",B08HZ5Y8RY,1609112222393,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,5 holo colors and 1 foil color!,"I'm really happy with these colors - most of my gels are just plain solid colors, so I definitely need more holo and glitters in general. All of these except for the silver are holo, so it's so hard to pick just one favorite, especially when the silver is a metallic foil!<br />All of the polishes are pictured in two coats just to show how that looks, but if you're going for full opacity you might want to do a third especially if you have long nails. Alternatively, you could wear them over a similar base color. They cured just fine under my lamp in 60 seconds; they are wipe colors though, so you either need to wipe them or put a top coat on. They're pictured without a top coat, because this kit didn't come with one. They're still wonderfully shiny without a top coat!<br />The bottles of this set come with numbered dots to label them, but not colored dots; however, it comes with a sheet of stickers that you can swatch them on your own. If you're like me and have other gels which also don't have colored dots, you might be happy to know this comes with a few extra stickers so you can do a couple of others too. Definitely recommend!",B08CVCLVS2,1608601416848,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,Nearly one coaters,"With the exception of the glitter in this set, they're pretty much one coaters! All cured in 60 seconds; the creme colors are nice, but I got this set for the magnetic ones and I'm not disappointed! Even without the magnetic effect, those two polishes are shimmery and beautiful. With the magnetic affect, they're very different, but still stunning. I actually feel that even with the magnetic affect, one coat was just fine. I added a second just to see what that looked like, and it made the edges darker, and the magnetic effect less profound, in my opinion. Still, this set is absolutely worth it! The tops of the bottles are labeled with a colored sticker for convenience, which is great.",B085TFXLH1,1607912756974,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,Chameleon shimmers!,"The black in this set is not even close to the best - it 100% requires two coats, and even then still isn't the best (pictured is two coats). But, I'm here for the shimmers, and I'm not disappointed! The tops of the bottles are labeled with a colored sticker for convenience, and the shimmers only require one coat over the black. It's hard to capture the color shifting on camera, but it's absolutely stunning! I couldn't recommend it more. It looks different at different angles, and over different colors. All polishes in this set cured in 60 seconds for me; they are pictured without a top coat since this set didn't provide one.",B085SY4WC3,1607912437182,5.0
AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,"Refreshing cucumber face mask, unpleasant texture","When I pulled the first of these masks out of the package, I didn't think that it would fit on my face at all. Mainly, because the eye holes were only about a centimeter wide, and the mouth hole was literally just a slit in the plastic. However, once I pulled off the plastic sheet that helps the mask keep its shape in the package, I found that these holes stretched, so it ended up working out okay, though I would still like for the eye holes to be a little bit longer as they barely fit around my eyes. Overall, because of the material / stretchiness of the mask, this fit my face better than a lot of other sheet masks do.<br />The main reason I'm giving only three stars is the feel of the mask itself. When I first touched it, my immediate thought was that it felt like a donut that sat in a pool of water for several hours and ended up being soggier than anyone should have to even imagine (trust me, I worked at a donut shop for years and this accidentally happened sometimes). My husband's reaction was that it felt like boogers. After taking it off and inspecting it a little more closely, we both thought it pretty much looked and felt like soggy toilet paper. Whichever answer you got with, it's not at all pleasant to touch, and not a pleasant texture moving around on your face either. Once you get it on, as long as you basically hold still and don't talk or anything, then it actually has a nice cooling, refreshing feeling. And it smells wonderfully like cucumber, which is what I was really hoping for!<br />The other reason I'm giving three stars is because it left my face feeling sticky for a long time after I removed the mask. Some masks leave a sticky feeling for a few minutes, but this one took almost two hours to absorb into my skin because it left so much. With other masks I don't normally help this along, so I didn't with this one either. When it finally did absorb, I was happy with how my face felt... I'm not against getting this mask again especially for the price because I did really like the cooling sensation in particular, it's just not one I'd get / use too often because of the gross, soggy feeling of the mask itself.",B08GJJ5RV9,1605223805093,3.0

You don't have to constantly change the heads on this.<br /><br />However, when you rotate the heads you have to hold down a button on one side and then use the very small rotater to change heads. It makes it a bit difficult to change the heads.<br /><br />Also, I had problems with it constantly stopping while I was using it. And my calluses aren't even that bad.

There are two containers of magnetic eye liner and one plastic tweezers.<br />The eyeliner has a thin brush which makes it simple to paint the black line where it needs to be and keep it straight. I had to go back and re-do the very edges to make sure there was enough to hold the lashes. These are easy to remove from the box with the tweezers and place onto the eyes. I was surprised how well the lashes hold...it's not over grippy but they stay in place as long as you don't knock them around. The felt a bit scratchy along the corner to the nose, although it wasn't really rubbing. This sensation was only slight and soon forgotten.<br /><br />The eyelashes are easy to remove and place back into the box for re-usage. The eyeliner came off so much easier than I thought it would....with a little warm water. It balls off into tiny chunks and doesn't run or scuff or leave marks behind.<br /><br />These work better than I thought they might and I will be using them again.",B08KJF6Y6C,1611518636515,5.0

It is smooth and thick enough to easily dip out of the jar with the fingers. It has a definite water-base feel to it.<br />It spreads onto the skin easily and sinks in relatively quickly. The skin does feel slightly tighter(? I guess I'll call it that) right away. I could tell where I had put the cream on and where not. It moistens the skin, and the citrus smell lingers.

The mask-fluid is pinkish and has the appearance of yoghurt. It has a flowery, soapy odor, but this isn't over-powering by any means. It's no problem to spread over the face and doesn't drip or run while doing so. It actually starts to foam the second it hits the skin. This was actually fun to watch (joy in little things) and tingles a bit, too. Even the foam stays in place and doesn't run off of the skin or drip.<br /><br />It is to be worn for 3 min, and then washed off....like a mud mask (but foam is simply more enjoyable than mud). It rinses off pretty easily and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and a pinkish hue. It's simply a nice experience and a change up from the usual masks and muds.",B08GS1G9BH,1605114200830,5.0
AFJOKSJE3KPYSUXT6TCKRRD4RO2Q,Moistens,"Cucumbers are supposed to be amazing for the skin. So, I wanted to give these a go.<br /><br />Pro: - moisten. Very moist.<br />  - mask doesn't rip or tear<br />  - plastic backing for easier application<br />  - gentle, pleasant aroma<br />  - sinks quickly into skin after massaging at end<br /><br />Cons: - thin<br />  - hard to slide into place...and then doesn't fit quite right<br />  - suggested wear time is 20-25 mins....longer than usual<br /><br />These masks come individually packaged in robust and easy to open pouches. The mask has a sturdy, plastic backing, which is the only reason it can be unfolded and placed on without any trouble because these are thin. Surprisingly, they don't rip or tear easily, though. After taking off the backing, it takes a little maneuvering to get these to sit in place. Firstly, the thin material wanted to bunch and roll along the edges of the face, and the lack of thickness made it difficult to get to lay flat. Also, the eye holes aren't quite right. I, my son, and my daughter tried them (each with very different face sizes) and all of us had trouble with the eyes. When they were in position, The bridge of the nose wouldn't stay pressed against the skin, but kept lifting up. The suggested wear time is 20 to 25 minutes, which is longer than the 15 to 20 I normally see on masks. Removing the mask, however, is no problem, and there's a good amount of moisture left over to massage into the skin....which also works well<br /><br />The masks are moistening and have a gentle, pleasant odor (although I can't really place it). These are refreshing and leave the skin shiny. If only they'd sit better, I'd enjoy them more.",B08GJJ5RV9,1604066935059,3.0

This one sits well on the edge of the tub/shower and doesn't tip over every time I reach for it. The pump top works well and makes it easy to get soap without fiddling. It smells nice without being overwhelming and doesn't hang forever on the skin. The soap itself doesn't sud up as much as I'd like (can there be enough bubbles?), but it's not bad, either.

AGFLDIUYV2PKF5Q7IEMULR52GW2Q,Great Product!,This is a great product for beards and facial hair.  It helped to moisturize and freshen up stiff bristles and gives a fresh look.

I did a base, then another gel polish solid color, then the glitter, and then topcoat.<br /><br />Between the color and the glitter, they started to separate. I didn't see anything wrong with either set of ingredients. The glitter also, perhaps my coats weren't thin enough, but they would snag and tear easily.

It is matte (as advertised) when applied but doesn’t feel like that drying matte lipstick some brands have. I also love the packaging - it container it comes in has a soft silicone texture.

I think it’d be more pleasant if it’s base notes were more of the predominant scent. But this just is a no go for me. I sprayed it on my forearm, rubbed it in a little and waited a few minutes. Still smelled elderly but a little more spicy. I can’t recommend the scent to anyone.

They don’t leave my skin feeling dry, tight or flakey. They sudz up really nice and quickly. After each use, my skin looks brighter and fresh. I hate that you only get 15 in a container. I feel like for where they’re priced - they should give you at least 20 pads in a container. Also, do be aware that all instructions/ingredients are in Chinese so you’ll have to reference the instructions here on amazon.

It took off everything except my eyeliner which I don't know if that was the microfiber clothes fault or the fact that it was waterproof. I'm super impressed. It also took off my matte lipstick that's usually a pain to get off. I haven't put these through the wash but we'll see how well they hold up.

AGV2YW5B3SCKG6WV422CIITZOGRQ,Works Beautifully For My Fair Complexion,"Let me start off by saying I am fair skinned so it's hard to find a bronzer that doesn't look so harsh with my complexion. This was offered to me to try in return for an honest review. So, upon first getting this - it was relatively heavy for just a bronzer/highlight. When I got the duo out, I realized why. The packaging that the actual bronzer/highlight is in is made of some heavy glass like material. It's packaged really pretty though.  There's not a lot of product that comes in the container. But, you get a beautiful golden bronzer and a peachy highlight. The bronzer actually looks very natural on my fair skin. It's not harsh or orange. It looks like a natural shadow on my face - granted you apply bronzer with a light hand - anything that's applied heavy will look harsher. I only use bronzer in the hollows of my cheek and jawline. The highlight is subtle but just enough for on top of my cheek bones and my cupids bow. Overall, I love that this duo looks very natural on me and that it goes on lightly - you can achieve a darker bronzer by layering it. I am a little shocked by how pricey this is but the packaging should've been an inclination that this was going to be a rather expensive duo. This works really beautifully for my fair complexion but I'm just not sure I'd pay this price tag for a bronzer/highlight duo..",B01EK2F1PC,1592470041663,4.0
AGV2YW5B3SCKG6WV422CIITZOGRQ,The Liner Is Super Tacky,"This is my third set of magnetic lashes and liner (I'm obsessed and will never go back to the glue). You get 5 different kinds of lashes in this set (I personally like the third set the best). Two liners and a tool to help apply the lashes but I don't use it - it's easier to not. However, I do press my real lashes to the fake to make it more inconspicuous. My problem with this set is the liner. For one, its VERY tacky. Even after it dries. My lower lid kept sticking to my upper eyelid any time I'd blink. Secondly, the liner is watery looking when applied. Like it's transparent almost and takes a few coats to get a solid line. Even with the first coat dried, the liner was tacky. The lashes did stay with the liner but I can't get past how tacky the liner is. Thankfully I have some other brand of magnetic liner that I can use with these lashes so this wasn't a complete bust. But kind of defeats the purpose when you buy a set like this. Also, in case you're new to magnetic lashes (well this particular kind) they have like 4-5 really small magnets on the band that adhere to the magnetic liner. You can't see the magnets unless you take the lashes off and show someone. Anyways, I've deducted two stars for the poor liner.",B086JN17SK,1591955441913,3.0
AGV2YW5B3SCKG6WV422CIITZOGRQ,Added Comfort To My Soaks,"So, I know this says spa pillow but I don’t have a luxurious soaking tub (yet). I just have your standard plastic tub insert. I take hot soaks 1-2x a week as a way to relax and ease my chronic aches. I got this in hopes it’d add some comfort for my back and neck during my soaks. It’s big in our tub insert but I like that. It’s comfortable and helps with my spine not hitting the cold tub. I wish it was a bit more conforming/squishy but it does work well in supporting my back and neck. The suction cups stick well to the tub and haven’t had any issues with them popping off. This is a nice tub pillow and works well for added support and comfort.",B082DXHTX8,1584644354407,4.0
AGV2YW5B3SCKG6WV422CIITZOGRQ,Salon Manicure At Home,"I got this gel nail set on a whim. I wasn’t really expecting much from it or for it to work well. I was super skeptical as I was doing my sisters nails. She has much more elegant hands and long nails so hence why she was my model for trying this gel kit. The instructions are clear and explain what is used for what and how to use them in the proper steps. The instructions also come with tips which were helpful. You get a UV light, a buffer and pads, topcoat, peel off base coat, two colors, prep it and end it solution. The UV light is a plug in and not battery operated. It is a bit of a time-consuming process – it took me about an hour to do my sisters nails. I love the gray that comes in this set, but the pink leaves a bit to be desired. The gray applies beautifully and isn’t translucent unlike the pink. The pink was still translucent even after two coats. The instructions state to cure it for 45 seconds (well this is how long the UV light stays on) but her nails were still sticky. So, I cured them several more times and they remained sticky. I finally decided to just finish them with the topcoat. I cured them then the instructions stated to take a pad with the end it solution and rub her nails to rid the tacky coating. I was super nervous about this step and was worried that all my work and her patience would’ve been for nothing. After wiping her nails, I didn’t see any polish transfer or dents on her nails.  Which I had let out a sigh of relief. I suppose they’re tacky because of the sort of polish this is and didn’t need to cure it as much as I did. This was my first time doing anything like this, but I think her nails turned out nice. I’m sure with practice, I’ll get even better. I really love that you can get salon nails from the comfort of your own home. I also believe this kit is well worth the money. What you pay for this kit is what you’d pay in one salon visit, at least for me. I am so pleasantly surprised by how nice this is and so glad I decided to give it a try!",B0813ZQG3T,1584136790591,5.0
AGV2YW5B3SCKG6WV422CIITZOGRQ,Super Cute!,"These are super cute - I love the bow! I know the bow isn’t everyone’s cup of tea but I like it. I usually wear the black when doing my makeup or washing my face. They are stretchy and the material is very soft. The back tends to slide up though so I have to readjust it at times. But, I’ve always had that issue with any headbands I’ve worn so it just may be my head.. ha-ha. The value for six is also fantastic. I won’t use all six so I’ll probably use the rest as stocking stuffers or little add on gifts.",B082NKQ4ZT,1583963919701,4.0
AGROTY3KEQXC7OWGNLDMPTDPJXHA,Loved these unique top coats!!,For less than $20 you get practically endless polish looks. I applied them to white nails to see the effects clearly but you can get so many different results by applying them over different colors. The glitter one has the finer glitter effect which I think is gorgeous. The Fur one I thought was odd at first but with a few more coats it really grew on me (lol no pun intended) The speckled one was ok. But the cat eye - Oh My!! I put it over a purple polish base and wow the pictures do not do it justice. I love it and can't wait to try it over other colors.,B08W4WQMNM,1618623620508,5.0
AGROTY3KEQXC7OWGNLDMPTDPJXHA,Not sure if it works yet,I have only used this a few times so I'm not sure yet if it works. It is a higher price point but I like the applicator and the serum so far. The brush is very easy to use just like putting on mascara. The serum is a very lightweight oil with no scent. It almost feels like you are putting nothing on it is so light.,B08J7R5HHX,1609615231703,3.0
AGROTY3KEQXC7OWGNLDMPTDPJXHA,Cool colors and easy to use,This is an affordable set of gel polish. It comes with 6 colors and 2 of those are the cat eye polish which I am a little obsessed with at the moment. You get a magnet stick in this set to activate the cat eye look. It's simple to do and looks awesome. The glitter polish in this set was ok too. The bottles are quite small but these sets seem to me like they are almost sample packs and when you find some you really like then you can look for it in bigger bottles.,B085TFXLH1,1609550501240,4.0
AGROTY3KEQXC7OWGNLDMPTDPJXHA,Love the options at a good price,"This set comes with the different color poly gels and the forms. The tubes are pretty small so I dont think you will get more than a couple of sets out of each one but with all the different options you can mix and match and really get a lot of looks out of this kit. I also really appreciate when  a company takes the time so it doesnt feel like it was just mass shipped to you straight from an assembly line. In this case, the box they were shipped in was nice and packed with the blue crinkle paper. Not really necessary but a nice little attention to detail in aesthetics.",B08DHZW3LK,1603044389667,4.0
AGROTY3KEQXC7OWGNLDMPTDPJXHA,Quality pack of 3 for less than $10.,These loofahs are great.

I ended up getting out my nail polish swatch sticks so that I could try every single one of these out. Each were so very different in their own way. I really like the speckled top coat. It makes some more lighter pastel polishes look like easter/spring egg shells. There's a really pretty velvet top coat that makes the color of gel polish underneath look and feel soft to the touch.

AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,"Actually ""Invisible"" Magnets","I have tried other magnetic lashes before but you can see each individual magnet and they are not comfortable at all. This set of magnetic lashes are very different. The entire length of the lash is a thin but strong strip of magnet. It is flexible and you almost don't realized it is even there. It looks like your typical false lash. I apply my eye makeup, then my regular liner. After that I use the special magnetic liner along the lash line, over top my regular liner exactly where I want the magnetic lashes to adhere. I only wait a few minutes before the magnetic liner is dry, then I apply the lashes and they stick like MAGIC! I love how these stay in place all day but also the fact that I can actually take these off and readjust as the day goes on. Be sure to wait until the magnetic liner is dry or you will end up with liner stuck to the lashes rather than your eye. I love that I can wash these and reuse them. Removal is simple, you just peel off the lashes WITHOUT any pain what so ever. The magnetic liner is fairly easy to get off with soap and water or an oil based makeup remover. So much easier than that awful glue that can stick around for days on days!",B08NTD1NM1,1612981786242,5.0

I am going more silver soon, so I know it will work well with that hair color as well! As for moisture, I felt like the shampoo was a little drying but the conditioner made up for that. I do wish this had more of a nice scent to it as it was kind of bland. It did the job well though, so I cannot complain much! My hair is a lot brighter and less brassy in the end and that is all I can ask for!",B08GMC48QF,1612811079961,4.0
AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,Amber Glass Spray Bottles,I love these 16oz amber glass spray bottles so much! I used these to put my own homemade room and sanitizing spray in. The amber glass is so beautiful. I love that these bottles are glass rather than plastic as essential oil can break down plastic over time. I get a fairly good mist from these as well. These bottles seem to be made very well and are of high quality.,B08HGZXLP6,1610820188967,5.0
AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,Dried Flower Bath Bombs,"These little flower bath bombs are so pretty and smell amazing. I read that you could use these for blooming teas too but not sure that I would, though I do like those. I love using these every once in a while during a bath with a regular bath bomb or bath salts to add a little extra something for a little self care time. I love how some of these spread the petals all over and some bloom as a whole flower. Each are individually wrapped for easy, mess free storage. A really beautifully curated set of dried flower bombs!",B08KT7FCYY,1609855432388,5.0
AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,Nail Stamping Plate Set,"I used to do a lot of nail stamping back in the day and cannot find my older plates for the life of me! I ordered this set because I loved the holiday designs and remembered how much fun these were. I like that this came with a clear silicon stamper. It is so much easier to see that you've picked up the design and where you are trying to place it. This also came with a thick sturdy scraper, about the size of a debit card. It actually scrapes quite nicely and doesn't scratch up the plate like other scrapers I have used in the past. With regular polish, this works very well but you have to work quick. With gel polish, you have to let the polish set into the design for about 20 seconds, scrap, let set another 20 seconds, then pick up the design. You also have to really know exactly where you want to place your design and instead of rocking back and forth, you firmly place down the stamp for the best, most crisp stamp. If not, with gel, it tends to be less crisp or smear. It's definitely a learning curve if you are working with gel. Still, this set works really well and I can do more designs rather than trying to hand paint details on. Love this nail stamping set!",B08G4Y4SFV,1608580107175,5.0
AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,CONBOLA Make Up Organizer,"Loving this makeup organizer so much! I usually have an over flow of makeup and brushes even though I try to purge from time to time the items that I do not use. This makes it so much easier to see what make up I am currently using. Love the little compartments and the attached mirror! I might also end up using this for jewelry as well since I think I don't like the clutter of jewelry I have going on right now. I like that this is also somewhat portable because I can move this room to room without spillage. Overall, a really great way to organize your jewelry or makeup items!",B08LZ6W8RF,1608571279310,5.0
AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,6 PCS Purple Eyeshadow Sticks,"I love the colors and names of these eyeshadow sticks. I am normally an eye shadow powder girl but wanted to give these sticks a try. They are very pretty and sheen. They blend out well too. However, they are not super pigmented so I use powder shadow and these mixed to create the look I really want to get. These apply super smooth and I haven't noticed a whole lot of creasing after a few hours of use like I have with other eye shadow creams. Overall, a really nice set of eye shadow sticks!",B08MPK4JRB,1608005923057,4.0
AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,Lucious Lashes,"This duo is a dream duo! I really needed a new eyelash curler and this is a really awesome one. I just had a lash lift done, so I barely have to curl my lashes but on days when I don't wash my lashes, this really helps mine add some nice curl to my lift. I like that the curler came with 3 soft pads, so I can replace as needed. Mine usually last a while so I'll be good for quite some time! I also really like this mascara. I am pretty picky when it comes to mascara because I already have fairly long lashes. I look for mascaras that add volume rather than length and this one does not disappoint. The mascara wand makes application a breeze. It is super easy to apply and wears all day long without having to reapply. A definite duo to add to any makeup lover's collection!",B08C24Q6LB,1596922123469,5.0
AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,Red Carpet Gel Polish Starter Kit,I love Red Carpet's nail line! This is the perfect gel nail starter kit! I've been looking for a smaller gel light compared to the large professional use light that I've been using. I really like every piece that comes in this gel nail set. I highly recommend this kit for beginners as it is very easy to use. I love that this kit has a nail prep step in it as some other similar kits do not have this. Can't wait to see all the beautiful nail creations I can make using this set!,B0BC273JJR,1596473410614,5.0
AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,Little to No Damage Easy Curls,"I absolutely love hair curl & wave forms. I have used these before but the wave curl form set when I had longer hair. These curl forms are super simple and easy to use! It is important to take small enough sections, but large enough to be able to cover your entire head. Taking too large of sections can create a pulling out of the hair and scalp, so be very careful! This set is the perfect length for my medium to short, shoulder length hair... give or take a few inches depending on whether or not I had a recent trim or not. I usually shower in the morning, but these curl forms definitely work best if you shower at night then dry or air your hair first about 50-80% of the way before using the hook to pull your small-medium sections of hair through. This cuts down on the drying and setting time. I like to put these in my hair before bed then wear a silk hair cap over night. You could also do this after a morning shower and let them dry and set while you do things around the house, but this always tries my patience. You can also use a dryer cap to speed up the process if you do this during the day or your morning routine. These create the perfect little ringlet curls. I always use hair spray, let set for approximately 5 minutes,  then tassel and/or finger comb through my hair after for a more natural curl look. I highly recommend trying these curl formers if you would like to try a little to no damage heat option for your hair!",B087FTZSZH,1596221162401,5.0
AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,"Magic Frizz ""Mascara""","I was hesitant to try this frizz control mascara want but I am sure glad I did! I used this for the first time on my hair part today and there are NO frizzy little baby hairs sticking up at my part! I am amazed what this magic little wand can do. I thought at first that it was going to continue to look wet like a gel at my roots but it dried up within just a few minutes and I am still frizz free near my part even a few hours later! The tube looks like a regular mascara tube and same with the application wand. It glides on very smoothly and I barely ever have to go over the same area more than once. This wand is a little miracle worker and believe you me, I have tried many tactics to get the little baby hairs to stay in place. So far, this is the only thing that has done the trick. What have I done without this my whole life?!",B0842BXM5M,1596154954020,5.0

Using this allows me to get everywhere and feel as though I've done so. My hair is thin and there are no issue with the hair getting trapped or snagging. I use the pink on my friend hair and she has commented that her hair washed is less rough. And on inspection the scalp is as clean as if I did it with my fingers. I also use this when I'm adding oils to my hair scalp. I use it to massage it in and again I feel as though the job has been effective after using it.

Although they are on the thinner side they have a natural pattern that goes thickest from the wefted hair and thins out to the bottom giving you a more natural look when installed. The hair has plenty of movement and very soft to the touch. The luster is there as you can see when my light hits it.

You can also pour the powder directly on your nails over a paper plate, then fold the plate to funnel it back into the container.<br />The dip powder works well, and the price is good, so I think it's a good purchase!",B08DRBZNZJ,1604872578751,5.0

The clips are pretty weak, both the one on bottom and the smaller ones on top, and didn't hold my hair. They feel pretty cheap.<br /><br />The method also seems pretty straight forward in theory, but more challenging in practice. Figuring out what hair to lift and where to place the clip underneath took some practice, and then the clip kept sliding while I was trying to put the twists in place.<br /><br />Needless to say, it looked nothing like the pictures.

AESI2BA4YODTHOSRFLJCSTAM6XDQ,Worth it? Yes and no.,"This mascara and eyelash curler combo has its pros and cons:<br /><br />The mascara - I actually really like this mascara, which I didn't expect, given the price and the cheap packaging it comes in. The formula is smooth and glides on easily, and the curled brush on the wand is dense enough and shaped just right to get every little lash. But most importantly, it stays on ALL day without running or flaking. I'd say it's pretty waterproof, but also comes off easily with eye makeup remover. I had a brand for mascara that I have been loyal to for years, but this is my new go-to in my makeup bag. And the price is great! My only issue with it is that it dries very quickly, so any mistake you make isn't going to budge. It also means that it's easy to make the lashes stick together if you don't apply it carefully.<br /><br />The eyelash curler - Actually I only have cons about this one. I hate it. It's shaped in a way that makes it difficult to use. The finger grips are set too far apart, making it awkward to squeeze, and the shape of the press is odd and it to angle my lashes into it. It's basically useless, and I tossed it in favor of my simple revlon lash curler.<br /><br />This mascara, however, I will be buying again!",B08C24Q6LB,1602037357427,4.0

It dries okay, and the smell is mild and pleasant. It washes off easily, and it did leave my softer and a little brighter.<br /><br />But it really didn't do much for the overall quality of my skin -  the softness and brightness were gone by morning, blackheads were still visible, and existing acne was not improved.<br /><br />I have personally tested a number of masks that did a lot more for my skin, and some at half the price.

The packaging is great, you get a big pack of the facial cleansing wipes and five of the face masks, and it all feels great on your skin.<br />My skin was softer after the mask. I suggest warming it first - I tossed it in its package right into my hot bath, along with the eye gel mask. The mask can be a little drippy ( they usually are), so soaking in the bath with it on means no clean up.<br />The lip treatment was great! My lips were a little dry and peeling, and after the treatment, they were so soft and moisturized.<br />Nothing had any unpleasant fragrances, either.

The deodorant on the PF brand slides on thicker and isn't as hard as the Native deodorant so it would be easier to apply too much with the PF than with Native. Not huge but something to consider.<br /><br />They both seem to do an equally good job at keeping odor away and I noticed no increase in odor while wearing the PF vs. the Native.<br /><br />Price-wise they are about the same so you really don't save money either way.<br /><br />Fragrance-wise I didn't really have a preference for one brand vs. the other, they both have a nice range of fragrance and there is enough variety to appeal to most people.<br /><br />Because of application, I will be sticking with Native, but if you are looking for something that glides on a bit thicker than this would be the best choice.",B086M8MZGB,1598889637062,4.0
